always to tell the old stories in the original
words, which are, in almost all cases, the
best. If any readers of this book can get
a sight of two big volumes called “Drake
and the Tudor Navy,” by Julian Corbett,
they may consider themselves fortunate. In
them there are the most fascinating reproductions
of pictures of old fighting ships,
and old charts or maps of the taking of
Cartagena, St. Domingo, and St. Augustine
by Drake’s ships. Here the ships are seen
approaching and attacking; the towns are
shown, and the soldiers, and the seas are
full of wonderful curly monsters. The old
charts of the invasion of the Spanish Armada
show the shifting position of the fleets from
day to day, and the books also contain
many maps and a fine portrait.</p>

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE</p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">PHILIP OF SPAIN</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">uring</span> the life of Francis Drake,
Philip the Second of Spain was the
most powerful king in Europe. Spain
and the Netherlands belonged to him, parts
of Italy, France, and Germany, and a great
part of America. From Mexico, Peru, and
the West Indian Islands Spanish ships
sailed home with treasure of silver and
gold, as they do in fairy tales, while
Portuguese ships traded in Africa for
slaves and gold and ivory, and had even
ventured as far as the then little-known
East Indies. Lastly, Philip added Portugal
and its possessions to his vast inheritance,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>and would have liked to hold all the world
“for God and for Spain.” Being himself
a good Catholic, he wished to see all men
of that faith, and to those who did not
believe in it he was a merciless foe, and
he shed the blood of many martyrs.</p>

<p>Now Drake hated Philip and the Pope
more than anything in the world, as
much as he loved England and honoured
his own Queen Elizabeth. He spent most
of his life in making war against the King
of Spain in one way or another, calling it
all, as he told Queen Elizabeth, “service
done to your Majesty by your poor vassal
(or servant) against your great enemy.”</p>

<p>During Drake’s life wars about religion
were raging in almost every European
country. In France the struggle ended by
most people remaining Catholics, just as
England, after Elizabeth’s reign, was always
a Protestant country. But such changes
really take long to come about, especially
in days when news travelled slowly, when
there were no trains or steamships, and no
penny newspapers.</p>

<p>Francis Drake was born when Edward
the Sixth was king, in a farmhouse near
Tavistock in Devonshire; but while he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>quite a young child his father, who was a
Protestant, had to fly from his country home,
owing to an outbreak of anger among his
Catholic neighbours. So the first stories
the little Francis would hear must have
been tales of this time of persecution, when
many of his father’s friends had to hide
in woods and caves, and lost all they possessed.
From his very cradle he must have
been taught to hate the “Papists.”</p>

<p>The new home was rather a strange
one, for the old books say Drake’s father
went to Kent, “to inhabit in the hull of a
ship, wherein many of his younger sons
were born. He had twelve in all, and as
it pleased God that most of them should
be born upon the water, so the greater
part of them died at sea.” The father
seems to have been a sailor at one time,
and he now got a place among the seamen
of the King’s Navy, to read prayers to
them. The Navy ships were anchored off
Chatham when not in use, and here, in an
old unused warship, the elder Drake and
his family made their floating home. Here
most of the twelve boys were born, a
troop of merry children, and many a fine
game they must have had on the decks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>The sound of wind and waves must have
been familiar to them as they went to sleep
at nights, and they grew up strong and
fearless, and, living as they did among
sailors, must have early set their hearts on
going to sea and having adventures.</p>

<p>At the death of King Edward the Sixth
the Catholic Queen Mary began to reign,
and Philip, then Prince of Spain, came over
to marry her. He looked “very gallant,”
they said, in his suit of white kid, covered
with gold embroidery, and was followed by
a train of splendid-looking Spanish nobles,
and he brought quantities of gold and silver,
borne on the backs of horses. But the
English people hated the foreign marriage,
and so strong was this feeling that in the
winter before the wedding even the children
in the streets shouted against the Spaniards
and snowballed them as they went to Court.
Perhaps Francis Drake and his brothers
left their usual games to play at being
Philip and the English, like some other
lads, of whom we read that their play
became so real and exciting that they were
only just prevented from hanging the boy
who acted the part of Philip. The King of
Spain might have seen his son upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>English throne, but this hope, like so many
of his, was doomed to be defeated, for
Mary died childless, and Elizabeth came to
the throne.</p>

<p>As Drake’s father was at this time a poor
man, he put his son Francis to learn seamanship
of the master of a bark or small
ship that used to coast along the shore
and sometimes carried merchandise to
France and the Netherlands. At this time
he must have had to suffer many hardships
and to live a rough life, but he
learned his business well, and “was so
diligent and painstaking, and so pleased
the old man his master by his industry,”
that at his death he left his bark to Francis
Drake.</p>

<p>Later Drake grew weary of this little
ship, that “only crept along the shore,”
and longed for something more than such
safe and simple voyaging, so he seems to have
sold the bark and taken service with his
kinsmen, the Hawkins brothers, who were
rich merchants and owned and sailed their
ships. And so began Drake’s roving life.</p>

<span class="smaller">“THE TROUBLESOME VOYAGE”</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> four centuries before the sixteenth,
in which Drake lived, have been called
the Age of Discovery. The world widened
before men’s eyes as new lands and seas,
new peoples, and even new stars, became
known to them. The little country of
Portugal was the first to begin those
discoveries. Her ships explored the coasts
of Africa and traded there. One of her
mariners discovered the passage round the
Cape of Good Hope to India, the Spice
Islands, and China, and for long she had
no rival in her trade.</p>

<p>About fifty years before Drake was born,
America was discovered by Christopher
Columbus, an Italian sailor in the service
of Spain. The ships in use in those days
were very different to any we see now.
There have been three kinds of ships made,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>ships with oars, ships with sails, and ships
with steam. They are divided into two
kinds, fighting ships and merchant ships.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned galley was long and
low-decked, and could be rowed or sailed.
In the middle of the ship, between two
platforms or upper decks, the rowers were
chained to their seats. Three or four men
worked each of the long oars, or <i>sweeps</i>
as they were called. There were twenty-five
oars or more on each side of the ship.
The rowers or galley-slaves were generally
prisoners taken in war, and to “be sent to
the galleys” was a terrible fate. They lived
on the benches, ill-fed and ill-clothed, with
only an awning to cover them when in port,
though the low sides of the ships protected
them a little from the weather and from
the fire of the enemy. Drake seems always
to have released the slaves he took on
Spanish galleys. Once, we are told, they
included “Turks, Greeks, Negroes, Frenchmen,
and Spaniards.”</p>

<p>The sailors who worked the ships were
free. The ships were always armed, at
first with shields and spears and arrows,
later with guns and powder. With such
ships the Italians fought many great battles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>on the Mediterranean, and in such ships the
Norsemen had invaded England and raided
the Northern Seas; and, with his <i>caravels</i>,
or light Spanish ships, Columbus reached
the islands which he called the West Indies.
In later voyages he reached the mainland
of America, but to the day of his death he
always believed that he had found the coast
of Asia. Another Italian sailor, named
Amerigo, also in the service of Spain, gave
his name to the New World. The Italians
had long been good sailors and ship-builders,
and great fighters at sea, and they had the
glory of discovering America, though they
gained no possessions there.</p>

<p>Spain, at that time the most powerful state
in Europe, seized upon a great part of the
new land, and found there gold and silver
mines. The natives they first subdued and
afterwards forced to become Christians, as
the custom was in warfare with a Pagan
race.</p>

<p>The American Indians, however, have
never been easy to subdue, and have always
had an undying affection for their own way
of life. The Spaniards found them unfitted
for hard work in the mines. The Portuguese
had already captured negroes in their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>West African settlements, and numbers of
those were sent to America as slaves.</p>

<p>From the time of Henry the Eighth the
English were building and buying fine ships,
and learnt to sail them so well that they
began less and less to use the old galley
ship with its many oars. They traded mostly
with Spain and the Low Countries; but as
they got better ships, and became expert
sailors, they wanted to go farther away, to
discover new countries and get more trade.
They began to sail to the Canary Islands,
to Africa, and America.</p>

<p>The Hawkins family had taken a large
part in this new activity. The elder William
Hawkins had sailed to Brazil; and his
son, John Hawkins, with whom Drake took
service, made several voyages to the “Isles
of the Canaries.” Having learnt something
about the West Indies, he made several
voyages there, carrying with him numbers
of negroes to sell, whom he took, partly by
the sword, and partly by other means, on
the coast of Africa.</p>

<p>Hawkins and the other adventurers who
joined him brought home great riches. In
the account of those early voyages we see
the beginning of a quarrel with Spain, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>was to last through the reign of Elizabeth,
till Philip sent his great Armada to invade
England.</p>

<p>The third and most famous voyage of
John Hawkins to the West Indies was called
“the troublesome voyage,” for it ended in
disaster. It was the biggest venture that had
yet been made by the English, and Drake
took part in it. Hawkins sailed with six
ships. There were two “great ships” of
the Royal Navy&mdash;the <i>Jesus</i>, commanded by
Hawkins himself, and the <i>Minion</i>; the
<i>William and John</i>, named after and owned
by the Hawkins brothers; and three smaller
ones, the <i>Swallow</i>, the <i>Angel</i>, and the <i>Judith</i>,
the last being under the command of Francis
Drake.</p>

<p>They got slaves in Africa and sold them
in the West Indies, though not without
difficulty, because the Spaniards had been
forbidden by their king to trade with the
English. As they were about to start on
their way home, the ships met with fearful
storms, and as the <i>Jesus</i> was much shattered,
Hawkins made up his mind to seek for
haven. They were driven at last into Vera
Cruz, the port of the city of Mexico.
Here they sheltered, hoping to buy food and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>repair their fleet. Now in this very port
lay treasure which was said to be worth
thousands of pounds. It was waiting for
the fleet of armed ships which was to take
it safely back to Spain. The Spaniards were
much dismayed to see the English ships,
with their Portuguese ships and prisoners
captured on the voyage, come, as they
thought, to seize their treasure. It was
this very danger they had feared when
Hawkins first began his slave trade and
disturbed the peace of the Spanish colonies.</p>

<p>Next morning thirteen great ships appeared,
and proved to be a Mexican fleet
returning with a new Viceroy or Governor
from King Philip. A solemn and peaceful
agreement was made, and the Spanish
ships were moored alongside the English
ones, which were already in possession of
the harbour. However, the Spaniards afterwards
broke faith and fell upon the English,
and a great and fierce fight took
place, which lasted from ten in the morning
until night. The <i>Angel</i> and the <i>Swallow</i>
were sunk, and the <i>Jesus</i> so damaged that
it could not be brought away.</p>

<p>As the remaining ships were sailing away,
the Spaniards sent two “fire ships” after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>them. This was not an unusual way of
fighting in those days. The empty, burning
ships were sent to try and fire the
enemies’ ships, and were borne along, flaming,
by the wind, an awful and terrifying
sight. The men on the <i>Minion</i> became
panic-stricken, and set sail without orders.
Some of the men from the <i>Judith</i> followed
in a small boat. The rest were forced “to
abide the mercy of the Spaniards,” which,
Hawkins says, he doubts was very little.</p>

<p>“The same night,” he goes on, “the
<i>Judith</i> forsook us in our great misery. In
the end, when the wind came larger, we
weighed anchor and set sail, seeking for
water, of which we had very little. And
wandering thus certain days in these unknown
seas, hunger forced us to eat hides,
cats and dogs, mice, rats, parrots, and
monkeys.”</p>

<p>Some of the men asked to be put on
land, rather than risk shipwreck and starvation
in the overcrowded boat. Hawkins
did, in the end, get safely home, with his
weather-beaten ship, and the survivors of
his feeble, starving crew. But he says that,
if all the miseries and troubles of this
sorrowful voyage were to be written, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>tale would be as long as the “Book of
Martyrs.” Some of the men that were left
also reached England, after weary wanderings
and years of terrible sufferings. Some
were put to death as heretics, and others
were sent to the galleys as slaves. Others,
more fortunate, were sent to serve in monasteries,
where the monks made kind and
gentle masters.</p>

<p>Five days before Hawkins reached England,
the little <i>Judith</i> struggled into Plymouth
Harbour with Drake and his load
of men. William Hawkins sent him at
once to London on horseback, “post, post
haste,” as the old letters say. He carried
letters to the Lords of Council, and
to Sir William Cecil, the Chief Secretary
of the Queen. So he rode swiftly along
the country roads, only stopping to fling
himself off one weary, smoking horse on
to the back of a fresh one. The people
would gather round him as he made the
change, and wonder what great news was
going to town.</p>

<p>William Hawkins said in his letter: “There
is come to Plymouth, at this present hour,
one of the small barks of my brother’s
fleet, and as I have neither writing nor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>anything else from him, I thought it good,
and my most bounden duty, to send you
the captain of the same bark. He is our
kinsman, and is called Francis Drake.”</p>

<p>He was to tell the whole story, and the
Queen was to hear it. He was to tell of
the losses of John Hawkins, and of his
absence, which his brother says “is unto
me more grief than any other thing in the
world.”</p>

<p>Drake was much blamed at the time for
deserting his general. It is difficult for us
to see what he could have done. His little
ship was crowded, and he had small store
of food and water, and he no doubt thought
it best to get home as soon as possible.
His story of Spanish treachery and English
loss must have roused the countryside.
The excitement was at its height
when the <i>Minion</i> appeared off Cornwall.</p>

<p>A man “for goodwill” came riding to
William Hawkins, at Plymouth, to get help.
He sent a bark, with thirty-four mariners
and a store of fresh food and other necessaries.
And again letters were sent to
London with the news. Haste! haste! post
haste!</p>

<span class="smaller">NOMBRE DE DIOS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> was in January 1569 that the “troublesome
voyage” ended for Drake, and in
the summer of that year he married a
Devonshire girl, named Mary Newman.
The stories of his most famous voyages
are found in an old book, called “Sir
Francis Drake Revived.” This was first
printed by his descendant, another Sir
Francis Drake, in the reign of Charles the
First. It was written by some of the
voyagers, and it is thought that Drake
himself wrote part of it and corrected it.
It is supposed that Drake presented the
manuscript to Queen Elizabeth, for he dedicates
it to her as the “first fruits” of his
pen. He also says that his labours by
land and sea were not more troublesome
than the writing of it.</p>

<p>After his losses and misfortunes in the
Indies, it seems that Drake could get no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>amends from Spain, though he had lost
both kinsmen, friends, and goods of some
value. Queen Elizabeth could not think
of making war with Philip. Her country
was poor, her father’s navy was ruined.
She had no proper army, and she had
trouble enough on her hands in France
and Scotland.</p>

<p>Therefore Drake decided to help himself
in what he was pleased to call his quarrel
with the King of Spain. The old writer
says that the story of his life shows how
“so mean a person righted himself upon
so mighty a prince. The one was in his
own conceit the mightiest monarch in the
world, the other only an English captain.”</p>

<p>Drake now made two voyages that really
prepared the way for his great and famous
one to Nombre de Dios. He probably paid
his expenses by plundering ships or selling
slaves. On the 24th day of May 1572,
Drake started with his ship, the <i>Pascha</i>, of
Plymouth, and the <i>Swan</i>, of Plymouth, in
which his brother, John Drake, was captain.
They had on board seventy-three
men and boys. All of these came willingly,
and had not been <i>pressed</i>, or compelled
to serve, as the custom then was.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>
<p>Drake’s ships had a very good passage,
and never stopped till they reached one of
the West Indian Islands, in twenty-five
days. Here they stayed three days to refresh
the men, and to water the ships.
The third day they set sail for the continent.
They steered for a bay named formerly
by them Port Pheasant. It was a
fine, safe harbour. As they rowed ashore
in one boat, smoke was seen in the woods.
Drake manned and armed the other boats.</p>

<p>When they landed, it was found that a
certain Englishman, called John Garret, of
Plymouth, had lately been there. Some
mariners who had been with Drake in his
other voyages had shown him the place.</p>

<p>Garret had left a plate of lead, nailed fast
to a mighty, great tree, on which these
words were engraved:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center no-indent">“CAPTAIN DRAKE.</p>

<p>“If you happen to come to this port,
make haste away! for the Spaniards which
you had with you here, the last year, have
betrayed this place, and taken away all you
left here. I depart from hence this present
day of July, 1572.&mdash;Your very loving friend,</p>

<p class="right no-indent">“JOHN GARRET.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>The smoke came from a fire which Garret
and his company had made before they
went. It had been burning for at least
five days before Drake’s arrival. Drake
had brought with him “three dainty pinnaces,”
made in Plymouth, and stored on
board ship in pieces. He intended to put
them together in this place. So the ships
were anchored, and the place simply but
strongly fortified with great logs.</p>

<p>Next day an English boat appeared. The
captain was James Rance, and he had
thirty men, some of whom had been with
Drake the year before. They brought with
them a Spanish <i>caravel</i>, or merchant ship,
which they had taken the day before, and
a pinnace. They joined Drake’s expedition.
In seven days the pinnaces were set up
and furnished out of the ships. Some
negroes on a neighbouring island told them
that the townsfolk of Nombre de Dios
were in great fear of the <i>Cimaroons</i>, or
“Maroons,” as our sailors called them.
They had attacked the town of Nombre
de Dios, and the Governor of Panama was
to send soldiers to defend it. These were
negroes who had fled some eighty years
before from the cruelty of the Spaniards.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>They had married Indian women, and had
grown into a strong fighting tribe, who
had two kings of their own, and lived, one
on the east, and one on the west, of the
road from Nombre de Dios to Panama. This
was the road by which all the gold and
silver from the mines of Peru was sent to
the port of Nombre de Dios, to be shipped
for Spain. It was carried by trains of mules.</p>

<p>Drake hastened his plans. Three ships
and the <i>caravel</i> were left with Captain
Rance. He chose seventy-three men for
the three pinnaces (the fourth was that
taken by Captain Rance), took plenty of
arms, and two drums and a trumpet. The
men were drilled and given their weapons
and arms, which had been kept up till
then “very fair and safe in good casks.”
Drake encouraged them to the attack. In
the afternoon they set sail for Nombre de
Dios, and were very near before sunset.
They lay there under the shore, out of
sight of the watch, till dark. Then they
rowed near shore as quietly as possible,
and waited for the dawn.</p>

<p>But Drake found the men were getting
nervous, so when the moon rose “he
thought it best to persuade them it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>day dawning,” and the men had not time
to get afraid, for they got there at three
in the morning. They landed with no difficulty.
But the noise of bells and drums
and shouting soon told them that the town
was awake and alarmed. Twelve men
were left to keep the pinnaces and ensure
a safe retreat. Drake’s brother, with John
Oxenham and sixteen other men, went
round behind the King’s Treasure-house,
and entered the eastern end of the market-place.
Drake, with the rest, passed up the
broad street into the market-place, with
sound of drum and trumpets. They used
fire-pikes, or long poles with metal points,
to which torches of blazing tow were
fastened, and served both to frighten the
enemy and to light Drake’s men, who could
see quite well by them. The terrified
townsfolk imagined an army was marching
upon them.</p>

<p>After a sharp fight in the market-place
the Spaniards fled. Two or three of them
were captured, and commanded to show
Drake the Governor’s house. But he found
that only silver was kept there; gold,
pearls, and jewels being carried to the
King’s Treasure-house, not far off.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>
<p>“This house was very strongly built of
lime and stone for safe keeping of the
treasure. At the Governor’s house we found
the great door open where the mules are
generally unladen. A candle stood lighted
on the top of the stairs, and a fair horse
was saddled ready for the Governor himself,
or for one of his household. By this
light we saw a huge heap of silver in the
lower room. It was a pile of bars of
silver.</p>

<p>“At this sight our Captain commanded
straightly that none of us should touch a
bar of silver. We must stand to our
weapons, because the town was full of
people. There was in the King’s Treasure-house,
near the waterside, more gold and
jewels than all our pinnaces could carry.
This we could presently try to break open,
though they thought it so strong.</p>

<p>“But now a report was brought by some
of our men that our pinnaces were in danger
to be taken, and that we had better
get aboard before day. This report was
learnt through a negro named Diego, who
had begged to be taken on board our
ships when we first came. Our Captain
sent his brother and John Oxenham to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>learn the truth. They found the men
much frightened, for they saw great troops
of armed townsfolk and soldiers running
up and down. Presently, too, a mighty
shower of rain fell, with a terrible storm of
thunder and lightning. It came down
violently, as it does in these countries.
Before we could reach the shelter at the
western end of the King’s Treasure-house,
some of our bowstrings were wet, and
some of our match and powder hurt.</p>

<p>“Our men began to mutter about the
forces of the town. But our Captain, hearing,
told them: ‘He had brought them to
the mouth of the treasure of the world;
if they went without it, they might blame
nobody but themselves afterwards.’</p>

<p>“So soon as the fury of the storm was
spent, he gave his men no time to consider
their doubts, nor the enemy no time
to gather themselves together. He stepped
forward and commanded his brother and
John Oxenham to break the King’s Treasure-house.
The rest, with him, were to
hold the market-place till the business
was done.</p>

<p class="caption no-indent">Drake wounded at Nombre-de-Dios</p></div>

<p>“But as he stepped forward his strength
and sight and speech failed him, and he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>began to faint for loss of blood. And we
saw it had flowed in great quantities
upon the sand out of a wound in his leg.
He had got it in the first encounter, but
though he felt some pain he would not
make it known till he fainted, and so betrayed
it against his will. He saw that
some of the men, having already got many
good things, would seize any chance to
escape further danger. But the blood that
filled our very footprints greatly dismayed
our company, who could not believe that
one man could lose so much blood, and
live.</p>

<p>“Even those who were willing to risk
more for so good a booty would in no case
risk their Captain’s life. So they gave
him something to drink to recover him,
and bound his scarf about his leg to stop
the blood. They also entreated him to be
content to go aboard with them, there to
have his wound searched and dressed, and
then to return on shore again if he thought
good.</p>

<p>“This they could by no means persuade
him to, so they joined force with fair entreaty,
and bore him aboard his pinnace.
Thus they gave up a rich spoil only to save
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>their Captain’s life, being sure that, while
they enjoyed his presence and had him
to command them, they might recover
enough of wealth. But if once they lost
him they should hardly be able to get
home again. No, nor keep that they had
got already. Thus we embarked by break
of day, having besides our Captain, many
of our men wounded, though none slain
but one trumpeter. And though our
surgeons were kept busy in providing remedies
and salves for their wounds, yet the
main care of the Captain was respected by
all the rest.</p>

<p>“Before we left the harbour, we took
with little trouble the ship of wine for the
greater comfort of our company. And
though they shot at us from the town we
carried our prize to the Isle of Victuals.
Here we cured our wounded men, and
refreshed ourselves in the goodly gardens
which we found there abounding with
great store of dainty roots and fruits.
There was also great plenty of poultry
and other fowls, no less strange than delicate.”</p>

<span class="smaller">FORT DIEGO</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smcap">fter</span> the return to the ship Captain
Rance departed. But Drake had a
new plan in his head; he meant to attack
Cartagena, the capital of the Spanish Main.
Sailing into the harbour in the evening, they
found that the townsfolk had been warned
that Frenchmen and Englishmen were about.
Drake took possession of a large ship that
was outward bound. But the townsfolk,
hearing of it, took the alarm, rang out their
bells, fired their cannon, and got all their
soldiers out. Next morning Drake took two
more ships near the harbour, one of which
was bound to Cartagena with a letter of
warning against “Captain Drake.” Drake
sent his Spanish prisoners on shore, and so
ended his first attempt upon Cartagena.</p>

<p>He saw that the coasts were aware of his
presence. Yet he did not want to go away
till he had discovered the Maroons; for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>his faithful negro, Diego, had told him that
they were friendly to him as the enemy of
Spain. This search might take time, and
must be done in the smaller boats, which
were swifter and could explore the rivers.
He had not enough of men both to sail the
boats and the pinnaces; so he now decided
to burn one of the ships and make a storehouse
of the other. In this way his pinnaces
would be properly manned, and he could stay
as long as he liked. This was accordingly
done. For fifteen days the big ship lay
hidden in the Sound of Darien, to make the
Spaniards think they had left the coast.
Here Drake kept the men busy trimming
and cleaning the pinnaces, clearing the
ground, and building huts. Diego the negro
was a very good builder, and knew the ways
of the country well. The men played, too,
at bowls and quoits, and shooting with
arrows at targets. The smiths had brought
forges from England and set them up.
Every now and again the pinnaces crept
out to sea to plunder passing ships. Much
food was put away in different storehouses
to serve till they had “made their voyage,”
as they said, or “made their fortunes,” as
we should say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>Later, Port Plenty being found an unsafe
harbour, they moved to a new place, which
they fortified and called Fort Diego. They
now prepared to wait five months, because
the Maroons had told them that the Spaniards
carried no treasure by land during the
rainy months. They were not idle during
these months, for the ship and fort were left
in charge of John Drake, while Captain
Drake and John Oxenham went roving in
the pinnaces. They had many adventures,
being in some peril in their small boats, and
always at the mercy of the weather, while
at one time they were almost starving. Some
of the men got ill with the cold and died, for
they had little shelter on board. When they
got back to the ships they found all things
in good order; but they received the heavy
news of the death of John Drake, the Captain’s
brother, a young man of great promise.</p>

<p>“Our Captain then resolved to keep close
and go no more to sea, but supplied his
needs, both for his own company and the
Maroons, out of his storehouse. Then ten
of our company fell down sick of an unknown
disease, and most of them died in a
few days. Later, we had thirty men sick at
one time. Among the rest, Joseph Drake,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>another of his brothers, died in our Captain’s
arms.</p>

<p>“We now heard from the Maroons, who
ranged the country up and down for us, to
learn what they might for us, that the fleet
had arrived from Spain in Nombre de Dios.
The Captain prepared to make his journey
by land to Panama. He gave Elias Hixon
the charge of the ship and company and the
Spanish prisoners. Our Captain was advised
by the Maroons what provisions to
prepare for the long and great journey, what
kind of weapons, what store of victuals, and
what kind of clothes. He was to take as
many shoes as possible, because they had
to pass so many rivers with stone and gravel.
Twenty-eight of our men had died. A few
were left to keep the ship, attend the sick,
and guard the prisoners.</p>

<p>“We started on Shrove Tuesday, February
the third. At his departure our Captain gave
this Master strict charge, in any case not to
trust any messenger that should come in his
name with any tokens, unless he brought his
handwriting. This he knew could not be
copied by the Maroons or the Spaniards.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">here</span> were forty-eight men of the
party, of whom eighteen only were English.
The Maroons carried arms and food,
and got more food with their arrows from
time to time. Every day they began to
march by sunrise, and rested in the heat
of the day in shelters made by the Maroons.
The third day they came to a little town or
village of the Maroons, which was much
admired by the sailors for its beauty and
cleanliness. “As to their religion,” says
the story, “they have no kind of priests,
only they held the Cross in great awe.
But by our Captain’s persuasions, they were
contented to leave their crosses and to
learn the Lord’s Prayer, and to be taught
something of God’s worship.”</p>

<p>They begged Drake to stay with them
some days, but he had to hasten on. Four
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>of the best guides amongst the Maroons
marched on ahead, and broke boughs to
show the path to those that followed. All
kept strict silence. The way lay through
cool and pleasant woods.</p>

<p>“We were much encouraged because we
were told there was a great Tree about
half way, from which we could see at once
both the North Sea, from whence we came,
and the South Sea, whither we were going.</p>

<p>“The fourth day we came to the height
of the desired hill, a very high hill, lying
east and west like a ridge between the
two seas. It was about ten of the clock.
Then Pedro, the chief of the Maroons, took
our Captain by the hand, and prayed him
to follow him if he wished to see at once
two seas, which he had so greatly longed
for.</p>

<p>“Here was that goodly and great high
Tree, in which they had cut and made various
steps to get up near the top. Here they
had made a convenient bower, where ten
or twelve men might easily sit. And here
we might, with no difficulty, plainly see the
Atlantic Ocean, whence we now came, and
the South Atlantic (Pacific) so much desired.
South and north of the Tree they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>had felled certain trees that the prospect
might be clearer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption no-indent">The Maroon Chief showing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans<br />
from the tree-top</p>

<p>“Our Captain went up to this bower, with
the chief Maroon. He had, because of the
breeze, as it pleased God, a very fair day.
And he saw that sea of which he had heard
such golden reports. He prayed Almighty
God, of His goodness, to give him life and
leave to sail once in an English ship in
that sea! Then he called up the rest of
our men, and specially he told John Oxenham
of his prayer and purpose, if it pleased
God to grant him that happiness. He,
understanding it, protested that, unless our
Captain did beat him from his company,
he would follow him, by God’s grace! Thus
all, quite satisfied with a sight of the seas,
came down, and after our repast continued
our ordinary march through the woods.”</p>

<p>The last part of the march was through
high pampas grass. But now they began
to get glimpses of Panama, and could at
last see the ships in the harbour. Now
the march had to be more secret and silent
than ever, till at length they lay hidden in
a grove near the high road from Panama
to Nombre de Dios. From here a Maroon
was despatched, clothed as a negro of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>Panama, as a spy. He was to go into the
town and learn when the treasure was to
be taken from the King’s Treasure-house
in Panama to Nombre de Dios. This
journey to Venta Cruz was always made
by night, because of the heat and toil of
walking through the pampas grass. But
from Venta Cruz to Nombre de Dios they
travelled always by day and not by night,
because the way lay through fresh, cool
woods. The mules were tied together in
long trains, and guarded, if possible, by
soldiers, for fear of the Maroons.</p>

<p>The spy brought back news in the afternoon
that a certain great man intended
to go to Spain by the first ship, and was
going that night towards Nombre de Dios
with his daughter and family. He had
fourteen mules, of which eight were laden
with gold and one with jewels. There were
also two other trains of fifty mules each,
mostly laden with food, and with a little
silver, which were to come out that night
also. Upon hearing this they marched
until they came to within two leagues of
Venta Cruz. Then Drake lay down with
half his men on one side of the way, about
fifty paces off, in the long grass. John
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>Oxenham, with the captain of the Maroons
and the other half of the men, lay on the
other side of the road at the same distance.
In about half-an-hour’s time they could hear
the mules both coming and going from Venta
Cruz to Panama, where trade was lively
when the fleet was there. The sound of
the deep-voiced bells which the mules wore
carried far in the still night. The men had
been strictly charged not to stir or show
themselves, but let all that come from Venta
Cruz pass by quietly, for they knew the
mules brought nothing but merchandise
from there. But one of the men, called
Robert Pike, had “drunk too much brandy
without water,” and forgot himself, and with
a Maroon went close to the road.</p>

<p>“And when a cavalier from Venta Cruz,
well mounted, with his page running at
his stirrup, passed by, he rose up to look,
though the Maroon, more cautious, pulled
him down and tried to hide him. But by
this time the gentleman had noticed that
one half of him was white, for we had all
put our shirts over our other clothing
that we might be sure to know our own
men in the pell-mell in the night. The
cavalier put spurs to his horse, and rode
away at a gallop to warn others.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>
<p>“The ground was hard and the night
was still, and our Captain heard this gentleman’s
trot change to a gallop. He suspected
that we were discovered, but could
not imagine by whose fault, nor had he
time to search. The gentleman, as we
heard afterwards, warned the Treasurer,
who, fearing Captain Drake had come to
look for treasure on land, turned his train
of mules aside from the way, and let the
others which were coming pass on. Thus,
by the recklessness of one of our company,
and by the carefulness of that traveller, we
were disappointed of a most rich booty.
But we thought that God would not let
it be taken, for likely it was well gotten by
that Treasurer.</p>

<p>“The other two mule trains, which came
behind that of the Treasurer, were no
sooner come up to us than we stayed and
seized on them. One of the chief carriers,
a very sensible fellow, told our Captain by
what means we were discovered, and counselled
us to shift for ourselves betimes,
for we should encounter the whole force
of the city and country before day would
be about us.”</p>

<p>Drake and his men were little pleased
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>at the loss of their golden mule-trains, for
they had only taken two horse-loads of
silver. It was the more provoking that
they had been betrayed by one of their own
men. There was no help for it, and Drake
never “grieved at things past,” so they
decided to march back the nearest way.
Pedro, the chief of the Maroons, said he
“would rather die at Drake’s foot than
leave him to his enemies.” When they got
near Venta Cruz, they turned back the
mules with their drivers. Outside the town
the soldiers met them, and a fight took
place upon Drake’s refusing to surrender.</p>

<p>“The soldiers shot off their whole volley,
which, though it lightly wounded our Captain
and several of our men, caused death
to one only of our company, who was so
powdered with hail-shot that we could not
recover his life, though he continued all that
day afterwards with us. Presently, as our
Captain perceived their shot to come slacking,
like the last drops of a great shower
of rain, he gave his usual signal with his
whistle, to answer them with our shot and
arrows.</p>

<p>“The Maroons had stept aside at first
for terror of the shot. But seeing that we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>marched onwards they all rushed forward,
one after the other, with their arrows ready
in their bows, and their manner of country
dance or leap, ever singing, <i>Yo Pehò! Yo
Pehò!</i> and so got before us. They then
continued their leap and song, after the
manner of their country wars, till they and
we overtook the enemy. Our Maroons,
now thoroughly encouraged, when they
saw our resolution, broke in through the
thickets near the town’s end, and forced
the enemy to fly. Several of our men were
wounded, and one Maroon was run through
with one of their pikes, but his courage
and mind served him so well that he revenged
his own death ere he died, by
giving him that deadly wound.”</p>

<p>So they entered the town, and stayed
there some hours for rest and refreshment,
and the Maroons were allowed to carry
away some plunder. At sunrise they
marched away, for they had been gone
from the ship nearly a fortnight, and had
left the company weak and sickly. Drake
marched cheerfully, and urged on his weary
and disappointed men with brave promises,
but in the hurried march they had
often to go hungry. Three leagues from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>the port the Maroons had built a camp
or village while they were away, and here
they persuaded Drake to stop, as it had
been built “only for his sake.” “And indeed
he was the more willing to consent,
that our want of shoes might be supplied
by the Maroons, who were a great help to
us. For all our men complained of the
tenderness of their feet, and our Captain
himself would join in their complaint, sometimes
without cause, but sometimes with
cause indeed, which made the rest to bear
the burden more easily. These Maroons
did us good service all the time they were
with us. They were our spies on the
journey, our guides, our hunters, and our
house-wrights, and had indeed able and
strong bodies for carrying our necessities.
Yea, many times when some of our company
fainted with sickness of weariness,
two Maroons would carry him with ease
between them, two miles together; and at
other times, when need was, they would
show themselves no less valiant than industrious,
and of good judgment.</p>

<p>“From this town our Captain despatched
a Maroon with a token and a certain order
to the master. He, all those weeks, kept
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>good watch against the enemy, and shifted
in the woods for fresh food, for the relief
and recovery of our men left on board.”</p>

<p>When the messenger reached the shore
he hailed those on the ship, who quickly
fetched him on board. He showed Drake’s
token, the golden toothpick, and gave the
message, which was to tell the master to
meet him at a certain river. When the
master looked at the toothpick, he saw
written on it, “By me, Francis Drake.”
Then he believed the messenger, and prepared
what provision he had, and repaired
to the mouth of the river. About three
o’clock Drake and his men saw the pinnace,
and there was double rejoicing. The
wanderers seemed strangely changed in
face and plight to those who had lived in
rest and plenty on board ship. Drake, indeed,
was less so than the others. The
fasting and hard marches had done much,
but still more “their inward grief, for that
they returned without that golden treasure
they hoped for, did show her print and
footsteps in their faces.” But Drake was
determined to repeat the attempt.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">rake</span> well knew that delay and idleness
would soon spoil the spirits of
his men, so he at once divided them into
two companies, under himself and John
Oxenham, to go roving in the two pinnaces
in different directions and seek for food and
plunder. Some of the Maroons were dismissed
with gifts, and the rest remained
with a few men on board ship. The
Governor of Panama had warned the towns
so well that it was useless to attempt them
at present. Drake, in the <i>Minion</i>, took a
frigate of gold and dismissed it, somewhat
lighter, to go on its way. John Oxenham,
in the <i>Bear</i>, took a frigate well laden with
food of all kinds. Drake was so pleased
with this ship, which was strong and new
and shapely, that he kept her as a man-of-war
in place of the sunken ship. And the
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>company were heartened with a feast and
much good cheer that Easter Day.</p>

<p>Next day the pinnaces met with a
French captain out of Newhaven, whose
ship was greatly distressed for want of
food and water. Drake relieved him, and
the captains exchanged gifts and compliments.
The French captain sent Drake
“a gilt fair scimitar” which had belonged
to Henry the Third of France, and had in
return a chain of gold and a tablet. This
captain brought them the news of the
Massacre of St. Bartholomew’s Day, and
said he thought “those Frenchmen the
happiest who were furthest from France,
now no longer France but Frenzy.” He
had heard famous reports of their riches,
and wanted to know how he also could
“make his voyage.” They resolved, after
consultation, to take him and twenty of his
men to serve for halves. They now sent
for the Maroons.</p>

<p>A party was made up of twenty Frenchmen,
fifteen Englishmen, and some Maroons.
They sailed with a frigate and two
pinnaces towards a river called Rio Francisco,
to the west of Nombre de Dios.
There was not enough water to sail the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>frigate, so she was left in charge of a
mariner to await the return of the pinnaces.
They went on, and landed both captains
with their force. Those in charge of the
pinnaces were ordered to be there the
fourth day without fail. The land party
went on through the woods towards the
high road from Panama to Nombre de
Dios, where the mules now went daily.
They marched, as before, in silence. They
stayed all night a mile from the road, in
great stillness, and refreshed themselves.
They could hear the carpenters working on
their ships, which they did at nights because
of the fierce heat of the day. Next
morning, the 1st of April, they heard such
a number of bells that the Maroons rejoiced
exceedingly, and assured them they
should now have more gold and silver than
they could carry away. And so it came to
pass.</p>

<p>For three trains appeared, one of fifty
mules and two of seventy each, and every
mule carried 300 lbs. weight of silver,
amounting to nearly 30 tons. The leaders
of the mules were taken by the heads, and
all the rest lay down, as they always do.
The fifteen soldiers who guarded each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>train were routed, but not before they had
wounded the French captain sorely, and
slain one of the Maroons. They took what
silver and gold they could carry, and buried
the rest in the burrows made in the earth
by the great land crabs under old fallen
trees, and in the sand and gravel of a
shallow river.</p>

<p>After two hours they marched back
through the woods, but had to leave the
French captain to rest and recover from
his wound. Two of his men willingly
stayed with him. Later on a third Frenchman
was found to be missing. He had got
drunk, and overloaded himself with plunder,
and lost himself in the woods. They
afterwards found he was taken by the
Spaniards in the evening, and, upon torture,
revealed to them where the treasure was
hidden.</p>

<p>When they reached the river’s mouth,
they saw seven Spanish pinnaces at sea,
which had come out to search the coasts.
This made them fear their own pinnaces
were taken. But a storm in the night
forced the Spaniards to go home, and also
delayed the English pinnaces, for the wind
was so contrary and so strong that they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>could only get half way. For this reason
they had fortunately been unseen by the
Spaniards.</p>

<p>“But our Captain, seeing their ships, feared
lest they had taken our pinnaces, and compelled
our men by torture to confess where
his ships and frigate were. In this great
doubt and perplexity the company feared
that all means of returning to their country
were cut off, and that their treasure would
then serve them to small purpose. But
our Captain comforted and encouraged us
all, saying: ‘We should venture no further
than he did. It was no time now to fear,
but rather to haste to prevent that which
was feared. If the enemy have prevailed
against our pinnaces (which God forbid!),
yet they must have time to search them,
time to examine the mariners, time to execute
their resolution after it is determined.
Before all those times be taken, we may
get to our ships, if ye will, though not
possibly by land, because of the hills,
thickets, and rivers, yet by water. Let us,
therefore, make a raft with the trees that
are here in readiness, as offering themselves,
being brought down to the river
happily by this last storm, and let us put
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>ourselves to sea! I will be one, who will
be the other?’</p>

<p>“John Smith offered himself, and two
Frenchmen that could swim very well desired
they might accompany our Captain,
as did the Maroons likewise. They had
prayed our Captain very earnestly to march
by land, though it was a sixteen-days’
journey, in case the ship had been surprised,
that he might abide with them
always. Pedro was most eager in this,
who was fain to be left behind because he
could not row.</p>

<p>“The raft was fitted and fast bound; a
sail of a biscuit-sack was prepared; an oar
was shaped out of a young tree to serve
instead of a rudder, to direct their course
before the wind.</p>

<p>“At his departure, our Captain comforted
the company by promising ‘that, if it
pleased God he should put his foot in
safety on board his frigate, he would, by
one means or other, get them all on
board, in spite of all the Spaniards in
the Indies!’</p>

<p>“In this manner pulling off to sea, he
sailed some three leagues, sitting up to the
waist continually in water, and up to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>armpits at every surge of the waves, for
the space of six hours upon this raft. And
what with the parching of the sun and what
with the beating of salt water, they had all
of them their skins much fretted away.</p>

<p>“At length God gave them the sight of
two pinnaces turning towards them with
much wind, but with far greater joy to him
than can easily be guessed. So he did
cheerfully declare to those three with him,
that ‘they were our pinnaces! and that
all was safe, so there was no cause of
fear!’</p>

<p>“But look, the pinnaces not seeing the
raft, nor suspecting any such matter, by
reason of the wind, and night growing on,
were forced to run into a cove behind the
point, to take shelter for the night. Our
Captain seeing this, and gathering that they
would anchor there, put his raft ashore, and
ran round the point by land, where he found
them. They, upon sight of him, made as
much haste as they could to take him and
his company on board. For our Captain, on
purpose to see what haste they could and
would make in extremity, himself ran in
great haste, and so made the other three
with him, as if they had been chased by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>the enemy. And so those on board suspected,
because they saw so few with him.</p>

<p>“And after his coming on board, when
they demanded ‘how his company did?’ he
answered coldly, ‘Well!’ They all feared that
all went scarce well. But he, willing to rid
all doubts, and fill them with joy, took out
of his bosom a quoit of gold, thanking God
that ‘our voyage was made!’”</p>

<p>They then rowed up the river and rescued
the others, and brought back such of the
treasure as they had been able to carry with
them, and all returned to the ships by dawn.
There Drake divided the treasure equally
by weight between the French and the
English. During the next fortnight everything
was set in order, and the <i>Pascha</i> given
to the Spanish prisoners to go home in.
Meanwhile a party was sent out to try and
rescue the French captain and to seek for the
buried treasure. One only of the Frenchmen
managed to escape and was saved. Much
of the treasure had been discovered by the
Spaniards, but not all, and the party returned
very cheerful, with thirteen bars of silver
and a few quoits of gold. The Frenchmen
now left them, having got their shares of
the treasure. The ships parted when passing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>close by Cartagena, which they did in the
sight of all the fleet, “with a flag of St.
George on the main top of the frigate, with
silk streamers and ancients (national flags)
down to the water.”</p>

<p>Later on they anchored to trim and rig
the frigates and stow away the provisions,
and they tore up and burnt the pinnaces so
that the Maroons might have the ironwork.
One of the last days Drake desired Pedro
and three of the chief Maroons to go through
both his frigates and see what they liked.
He promised to give them whatever they
asked, unless he could not get back to
England without it. But Pedro set his
heart on the scimitar which the French
captain had given to Drake; and knowing
Drake liked it no less, he dared not ask for
it or praise it. But at last he bribed one
of the company to ask for him, with a fine
quoit of gold, and promised to give four
others to Drake. Drake was sorry, but he
wished to please Pedro, who deserved so
well, so he gave it to him with many good
words. Pedro received it with no little joy,
and asked Drake to accept the four pieces
of gold, as a token of his thankfulness and
a pledge of his faithfulness through life. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>received it graciously, but did not keep it
for himself but caused it to be cast into
the whole adventure, saying that “if he had
not been helped to that place he would never
have got such a thing, and it was only just
that those who shared his burden in setting
him to sea should enjoy a share of the
benefits.”</p>

<p>“Thus with good love and liking, we took
our leave of that people. We took many
ships during our abode in those parts, yet
never burnt nor sunk any, unless they acted
as men-of-war against us, or tried to trap
us. And of all the men taken in those
vessels, we never offered any kind of violence
to any, after they were once come into our
power. For we either dismissed them in
safety, or kept them with us some longer
time. If so, we provided for them as for
ourselves, and secured them from the rage
of the Maroons against them, till at last,
the danger of their discovering where our
ships lay being past, for which cause only
we kept them prisoners, we set them also
free.</p>

<p>“We now intended to sail home the directest
and speediest way, and this we happily
performed, even beyond our own expectations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
and so arrived at Plymouth, on Sunday
about sermon-time, August the 9th, 1573.</p>

<p>“And the news of our Captain’s return
being brought unto his people, did so speedily
pass over all the church, and fill their minds
with delight and desire to see him, that very
few or none remained with the preacher. All
hastened to see the evidence of God’s love
and blessing towards our gracious Queen
and country by the fruit of our Captain’s
labour and success.</p>

<span class="smaller">ROUND THE WORLD</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="smcap">o</span> we see that both of Drake’s ships, the
<i>Pascha</i> and the <i>Swan</i>, were left behind
in the West Indies, and he made a quick
voyage home in the well-built Spanish
frigate. We hear nothing of Drake for
two years after his return to Plymouth.
There is a legend that he kept on the
seas near Ireland. Elizabeth was still unable
and unwilling to go to war with the
King of Spain, but she was willing to encourage
the sort of warfare that Drake and
the other rovers had so successfully carried
on against him.</p>

<p>Such companies of adventurers as these
that sailed under Drake and Hawkins did
a large part of the work of the navy in
the time of Elizabeth. The country was
saved the expense which private persons
were willing to pay to furnish the ships.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>The Queen herself is known to have shared
in the expenses and plunder of some such
expeditions, and so she thriftily laid up
treasure in England’s empty money-chests.
But some of her older councillors disliked
exceedingly this way of getting rich, and
would rather it had been done openly in
war, or not at all.</p>

<p>To Drake it seems to have been a very
simple affair. He wished, in the first place,
as the old book says, “to lick himself whole
of the damage he had received from the
Spaniards.” So he acted in pirate-fashion
to the Spaniards, but not to the French
or to the natives of the West Indies. And
Drake considered his own cause so just
that he never made a secret of his doings.
He went at his own risk, for should he be
taken by the enemy his country had no
power to protect him, as she was not openly
at war with Spain. But, on the other
hand, he was secretly encouraged, and his
gains were immense.</p>

<p>In the second place, Drake wished to
attack and injure the Roman Catholic faith
whenever and wherever he could. Churchmen
had told him that this was a lawful
aim. How earnestly he believed it we can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>see from the story, where he tried to
persuade the Maroons to “leave their
crosses,” which to him were the sign of
the hated religion. The terrible tale of
the massacre of the Protestants on St.
Bartholomew’s Day told him by the French
captain (who himself fell into the hands
of the Spaniards, as we have seen), must
have inflamed this feeling in his soul and
in those of his men. It made them more
eager than ever to fight the enemies of
their own faith.</p>

<p>Then, too, the Spaniards founded their
rights to own the New World upon a
grant from one of the Popes; and the
English, now no longer Catholics, denied
his power to give it, and claimed the right
for themselves to explore and conquer and
keep what share they could get.</p>

<p>The King of Spain looked upon Drake
as a pirate, but he could not find out how
far he had been secretly encouraged by
Elizabeth, and Drake was not punished, in
spite of Philip’s urgent complaints. But
he was prevented from sailing away again
on a voyage of discovery, though his friends
and brothers went, and among them John
Oxenham, who was hanged as a pirate by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>the Spaniards because he had no commission
or formal leave from the Queen or the
Government to trade in the West Indies.</p>

<p>During this interval Drake took service
in Ireland, under the Earl of Essex, furnishing
his own ships, “and doing excellent
service both by sea and land at the
winning of divers strong forts.” The work
he took a part in was as harsh and cruel
as any that was ever done by fire and sword
to make Ireland more desolate. Here he
met Thomas Doughty, one of the household
of the Earl of Essex, a scholar and a soldier,
who became his friend, and sailed with him
on his next voyage.</p>

<p>The story of this voyage is told under the
name of “The World Encompassed,” and
in it Drake is said “to have turned up a
furrow about the whole world.” In 1520
Magellan had discovered the passage
south of America from the Atlantic to the
Pacific Ocean, since called by his name.
Many adventurers had tried to follow him,
but all their efforts had ended in disaster,
and the Straits had an uncanny name
among sailors, and “were counted so terrible
in those days that the very thoughts
of attempting them were dreadful.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>
<p>Drake’s fleet was made up of five ships&mdash;the
<i>Pelican</i>, which was his flagship, the
<i>Elizabeth</i>, the <i>Marigold</i>, the <i>Swan</i>, and the
<i>Christopher</i>. They took a hundred and sixty
men and plentiful provisions and stores for
the long and dangerous voyage. They also
took pinnaces which could be set up when
wanted. Nor did Drake forget to “make
provision for ornament and delight, carrying
to this purpose with him expert musicians,
rich furniture (all the vessels for his table,
yea, many belonging to the cook-room, being
of pure silver).”</p>

<p>They started on November 15, 1577, but
were forced by a gale to put back into
Plymouth for repairs, and started out again
on December 13. The sailors were not
told the real aim of the voyage, which was
to “sail upon those seas greatly longed
for.” They were too full of fears and fancies.
The unknown was haunted in their minds
with devils and hurtful spirits, and in those
days people still believed in magic.</p>

<p>They picked up several prizes on their
way out, notably a large Portuguese ship,
whose cargo of wine and food was valuable
to the English ships. Drake sent the passengers
and crew on shore, but kept the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>pilot, Numa da Silva, who gives one account
of the voyage, and was most useful, as he
knew the coasts so well. One of Drake’s
main cares on this voyage, we are told,
was to keep the fleet together as much as
possible, to get fresh water, and to refresh
the men, “wearied with long toils at sea,”
as often as possible. He decided to lessen
the number of the ships, for “fewer ships
keep better company,” and he looked for a
harbour to anchor in.</p>

<p>“Our General,” says the book, “especially
in matters of moment, was never one to rely
only on other men’s care, how trusty or
skilful soever they might seem to be. But
always scorning danger, and refusing no toil,
he was wont himself to be one, whosoever
was a second, at every turn, where courage,
skill, or industry was to be employed.
Neither would he at any time entrust the
discovery of these dangers to another’s
pains, but rather to his own experience in
searching out and sounding of them.”</p>

<p>So in this case Drake himself went out in
the boat and rowed into the bay. The <i>Swan</i>,
the <i>Christopher</i>, and the prize were sacrificed,
their stores being used for the other
ships.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>
<p>On the 20th of June they anchored in a
very good harbour, called by Magellan Port
St. Julian. Here a gibbet stood upon the
land, and in this place Magellan is supposed
to have executed some disobedient and rebellious
men of his company. In this port
Drake began to “inquire diligently into the
actions of Master Thomas Doughty, and
found them not to be such as he looked for.”</p>

<p>(Doughty is said to have plotted to kill
Drake or desert him, and take his place as
commander, or at any rate to force him to
go back, to the ruin of the voyage.)</p>

<p>“Whereupon the company was called together,
and the particulars of the cause made
known to them, which were found partly by
Master Doughty’s own confession, and
partly by the evidence of the fact, to be
true. Which when our General saw,
although his private affection to Master
Doughty (as he then in the presence of us
all sacredly protested) was great; yet the
care he had of the state of the voyage, of
the expectation of her Majesty, and of the
honour of his country, did more touch him
(as indeed it ought) than the private respect
of one man. So that the cause being
thoroughly heard, and all things done in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>good order, as near as might be to the
course of our laws in England, it was concluded
that Master Doughty should receive
punishment according to the quality of
the offence. And he, seeing no remedy but
patience for himself, desired before his
death to receive the Communion, which he
did, at the hands of our minister, and our
General himself accompanied him in that
holy action....</p>

<p>“And after this holy repast, they dined
also at the same table together, as cheerfully,
in sobriety, as ever in their lives they
had done aforetime, each cheering up the
other, and taking their leave, by drinking
each to other, as if some journey only had
been in hand.</p>

<p>“And the place of execution being ready,
he having embraced our General, and taken
his leave of all the company, with prayer for
the Queen’s Majesty and our realm, in quiet
sort laid his head to the block, where he
ended his life. This being done, our General
made various speeches to the whole company,
persuading us to unity, obedience,
love and regard of our voyage. And to help
us to this, he willed every man the next
Sunday following to prepare himself to receive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
the Communion, as Christian brethren
and friends ought to do, which was done
in very reverent sort, and so with good
contentment every man went about his
business.”</p>

<p>On the 11th of August, as quarrelling still
continued, Drake ordered the whole ships’
companies ashore. They all went into a
large tent, and the minister offered to make
a sermon. “Nay, soft, Master Fletcher,”
said Drake, “I must preach this day myself,
although I have small skill in preaching....
I am a very bad speaker, for my bringing
up hath not been in learning.”</p>

<p>He then told them that for what he was
going to say he would answer in England
and before her Majesty. He and his men were
far away from their country and friends, and
discords and mutiny had grown up among
them. “By the life of God,” said Drake, “it
doth take my wits from me to think on it.
Here is such quarrels between the sailors
and the gentlemen as it doth make me mad
to hear it. But, my masters, I must have
it left [off], for I must have the gentleman
to haul and draw with the mariner, and the
mariner with the gentleman. What, let us
show ourselves all to be of a company, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>let us not give occasion to the enemy to
rejoice at our decay and overthrow. I would
know him that would refuse to set his hand
to a rope, but I know there is not any such
here....”</p>

<p>He then offered to send any home that
liked in the <i>Marigold</i>, a well-furnished ship;
“but let them take heed that they go homeward,
for if I find them in my way I will
surely sink them, therefore you shall have
time to consider here until to-morrow; for
by my troth I must needs be plain with you
now.”</p>

<p>“Yet the voice was that none would return,
they would all take such part as he
did.” And so, after more of such “preaching,”
they were told to forget the past, and “wishing
all men to be friends, he willed them to
depart about their business.”</p>

<span class="smaller">ROUND THE WORLD (<i>continued</i>)</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smcap">n</span> the 20th of August the three ships
entered the Straits of Magellan. Before
the “high and steep grey cliffs, full of
black stars,” of Cape Virgins, at the entrance
against which the beating seas looked like
whales spouting, the fleet did homage to the
Queen. The name of the <i>Pelican</i> also was
changed to the <i>Golden Hind</i> in remembrance
of Drake’s “friend and favourer,” Sir Christopher
Hatton, whose crest was a golden
hind. In sixteen days they reached the
“South Sea,” Drake himself having rowed
on ahead of the fleet with some of his
gentlemen to find out the passage. He
had meant to land, and leave “a monument
of her Majesty graven in metal,” which
he had brought with him for that purpose,
but there was no anchoring, as the wind
did not let them stay; for a fearful storm
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>arose and separated the ships, and threatened
to send them all to the bottom of the sea.
The <i>Marigold</i>, indeed, went down with all
hands, and the <i>Elizabeth</i>, “partly by the
negligence of those that had charge of her,
partly through a kind of desire that some
in her had to be out of all those troubles
and to be at home again, returned back the
same way by which they came forward, and
so coasting Brazil, they arrived in England
on June 2nd the year following.” So that
now, as the story quaintly says, the other
ship, if she had been still called the <i>Pelican</i>,
would indeed have been a pelican alone in
the wilderness. Never did they think there
had been such a storm “since Noah’s Flood,”
for it lasted fifty-two days. The ship was
driven south of the continent of America.
At this time it was generally believed that
another great continent stretched to the
south of the Straits, which was called
the unknown land, “wherein many strange
monsters lived.” And now, when Drake had
discovered this idea to be false, their troubles
ended for the time, the storm ceased, but
they were in great grief for the loss of their
friends, and still hoped to meet the missing
ships again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>They sailed northwards along the coast
of America till they landed on an island to
get water. Here they were treacherously
attacked by Indians, who took them to be
the hated Spaniards. The nine persons who
were in the boat were all wounded, and
Drake’s faithful servant, Diego the negro,
died of his wounds, and one other. Drake
himself was shot in the face under the right
eye, and badly wounded in the head. They
were in the worst case, because the chief
doctor was dead, and the other in the <i>Elizabeth</i>.
There was none left them but a boy,
“whose goodwill was more than any skill
he had.” But, owing to Drake’s advice, and
“the putting to of every man’s help,” all
were cured in the end.</p>

<p>They sailed on, and having picked up a
friendly Indian who served as a pilot, they
reached the harbour of Valparaiso. A ship
which was lying in the harbour was seized,
and then the town and the Spaniards
discovered that Drake had reached the
shores of the Pacific. On the coast the ship
was trimmed and the pinnace put together,
in which Drake himself set out to search
the creeks and inlets where the ship could
not sail. Grief for the absence of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>friends still remained with them. Still
searching for the lost ships, they sailed
northwards on to Lima, where they got the
news that a great Spanish ship had sailed
from there a fortnight before, laden with
treasure. Drake at once gave chase, hoping
to take her before she reached Panama.
The first man who sighted her was promised
a chain of gold. The ship was overtaken
and captured off Cape San Francisco. She
was “the great glory of the South Sea,” and
laden with gold, silver, plate, and jewels, all
of which the English took. After six days
the Spanish ship was dismissed, “somewhat
lighter than before,” to Panama. To the
master of the ship, Saint Juan de Anton, he
gave a letter to protect him if he fell in with
the missing English ships.</p>

<p>“Master Winter,” it says, “if it pleaseth
God that you should chance to meet with
this ship of Saint Juan de Anton, I pray
you use him well, according to my word and
promise given unto them. And if you want
anything that is in this ship of Saint Juan
de Anton, I pray you pay them double the
value for it, which I will satisfy again, and
command your men not to do any hurt; desiring
you, for the Passion of Christ, if you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>fall into any danger, that you will not despair
of God’s mercy, for He will defend you and
preserve you from all danger, and bring us
to our desired haven, to whom be all honour,
glory, and praise for ever and ever. Amen.&mdash;Your
sorrowful Captain, whose heart is
heavy for you,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Francis Drake</span>.”</p>

<p>The next prizes captured yielded treasure
of a different kind, though equally precious.
These were some charts with sailing directions,
taken from two China pilots. The
owner of the next large Spanish ship
captured by Drake has left an interesting
account of him.</p>

<p>He says that “the English General is the
same who took Nombre de Dios five years
ago. He is a cousin of John Hawkins, and
his name is Francis Drake. He is about
thirty-five years of age, of small size, with
a reddish beard, and is one of the greatest
sailors that exist, both from his skill and
his power of commanding. His ship is of
near four hundred tons, sails well, and has
a hundred men all in the prime of life, and
as well trained for war as if they had been
old soldiers of Italy. Each one is specially
careful to keep his arms clean. He treats
them with affection and they him with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>respect. He has with him nine or ten gentlemen,
younger sons of the leading men in
England, who form his council. He calls
them together on every occasion and hears
what they have to say, but he is not bound
by their advice, though he may be guided
by it. He has no privacy; those of whom
I speak all dine at his table, as well as a
Portuguese pilot whom he has brought from
England, but who never spoke a word while
I was on board. The service is of silver,
richly gilt, and engraved with his arms. He
has, too, all possible luxuries, even to perfumes,
many of which he told me were given
him by the Queen. None of these gentlemen
sits down or puts on his hat in his presence
without repeated permission. He dines and
sups to the music of violins. His ship carries
thirty large guns and a great quantity of
ammunition, as well as craftsmen who can
do necessary repairs. He has two artists
who portray the coast in its own colours,
a thing which troubled me much to see, because
everything is put so naturally that any
one following him will have no difficulty.”</p>

<p>Drake wished to find his way home by
the north of America into the Atlantic.
But in this he was not successful, for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>weather was very severe, and tried the
men too much; meanwhile, they found a
convenient haven in a little bay above the
harbour of San Francisco, and now known
as “Drake’s Bay.” Here they stayed a
month, repairing a leak in the ship and
refreshing the men. They then set sail,
and saw nothing but air and sea for sixty-eight
days, till they reached some islands.
These they named the “Islands of Thieves,”
on account of the behaviour of the natives.
In November they came to the islands of
the Moluccas, where Drake had a splendid
reception.</p>

<p>They then sailed on till they arrived at a
little island, which they called the “Island of
Crabs.” Here they pitched their tents, and
set up forges to repair the ironwork of the
ship and the iron-hooped casks. Those
that were sickly soon grew well and strong
in this happy island.</p>

<p>On the 9th of January the ship ran aground
on a dangerous shoal, and struck twice on it;
“knocking twice at the door of death, which
no doubt had opened the third time.”</p>

<p>Nothing but instant death was expected,
and the whole ship’s company fell to praying.
As soon as the prayers were said,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>Drake spoke to the men, telling them how
they must think of their souls, and speaking
of the joys of heaven “with comfortable
speeches.” But he also encouraged
them to bestir themselves, and he himself
set the example, and got the pumps to
work, and freed the ship of water. The
ship was fast upon “hard and pinching
rocks, and did tell us plain she expected
continually her speedy despatch as soon
as the sea and winds should come ... so
that if we stay with her we must perish
with her.” The other plan, of leaving her
for the pinnace, seemed to them “worse
than a thousand deaths.”</p>

<p>After taking the Communion and listening
to a sermon, they eased the ship by
casting goods into the sea&mdash;“three ton of
cloves, eight big guns, and certain meal
and beans”; making, as an old writer says,
a kind of gruel of the sea round about.
After they had been in this state from
eight o’clock at night till four o’clock next
afternoon, all in a moment the wind changed,
and “the happy gale drove them off the
rocks again, and made of them glad men.”</p>

<p>The rest of the homeward voyage was
less adventurous, and on the 18th of June
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>they passed the Cape of Good Hope, “a
most stately thing, and the fairest cape we
saw in the whole circumference of the
earth.”</p>

<p>On the 26th of September they “safely,
and with joyful minds and thankful hearts,
arrived at Plymouth, having been away
three years.”</p>

<span class="smaller">SIR FRANCIS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> was in the autumn of 1580 that Drake
returned from his three years’ voyage.
Wynter had brought the news home that
Drake had entered the Straits of Magellan,
but since then only vague rumours of his
death at the hands of the Spaniards had
reached England. Had he met such a fate,
Sir William Cecil (now Lord Burghley) and
his party at Court would not have been sorry;
for they disliked piracy, and wished to avoid
a war with Spain.</p>

<p>This was more to be dreaded than ever,
as at the death of the King of Portugal
Philip had seized his crown and vast possessions,
and was now the most powerful prince
in Europe, since he owned the splendid
Portuguese fleet. Hitherto, Philip had only
warships for the protection of his treasure-ships,
and they could not be spared. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>was now known to be preparing, in his
slow way, a great Armada.</p>

<p>But Drake had not been hanged for a
pirate, and this the Spaniards knew very well.
They clamoured for the restoration of his
plunder, or the forfeit of his life. At this
time an army of Italian and Spanish soldiers,
under the command of a famous Spanish
officer, had been landed in Ireland to help
the Catholic Irish in their rebellion against
Queen Elizabeth. These soldiers were said
to have been sent by the orders of the Pope.
Finding the prospects of success too poor,
the Spanish officer withdrew his men, and
they escaped by sea; but the Italian soldiers,
who numbered 600, were overpowered by the
English, and all except a few officers, who
could pay a ransom, were slaughtered in cold
blood. Thus Philip’s attempt to strike a
secret blow in Elizabeth’s fashion was met
by her with cruelty as relentless as his own;
but Elizabeth made this attempt an excuse
for refusing to make an inquiry into Drake’s
doings in the West.</p>

<p>“The news of his home-coming in England
was,” we are told, “by this his strange
wealth, so far-fetched, marvellous strange,
and of all men held impossible and incredible.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>But both proving true, it fortuned that many
misliked it and reproached him. Besides
all this there were others that devised and
divulged” (made up and spread about) “all
possible disgraces” (base charges) “against
Drake and his followers, terming him the
Master Thief of the Unknown World. Yet
nevertheless the people generally with exceeding
admiration applauded his wonderful
long adventures and rich prize.”</p>

<p>Drake at once sent a message to tell the
Queen of his return. He was told he had
nothing to fear, and was summoned to Court.
He took with him some horseloads of gold
and silver and jewels. The Queen treated
him with great favour, and refused to take
the advice of Burghley and others, who
wished to send the treasure back to Spain.
Unlike them she took her share of the
profits, and also the fine gifts Drake had
brought for her. “But it grieved him not
a little,” we are told, “that some prime
courtiers refused the gold he offered them,
as gotten by piracy.” He and his men had
made golden fortunes.</p>

<p>The Spanish Ambassador naturally
“burned with passion” against Drake, and
considered his presence at Court an insult
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>to his king. “For he passes much time
with the Queen,” he wrote to Philip, “by
whom he is highly favoured.”</p>

<p>It was an insult Philip still felt himself
unable to avenge. Elizabeth had made a
fresh treaty with France, and Philip’s best
generals knew the difficulties of an attack
on England thus strengthened. Besides,
the Dutch, whom Elizabeth was helping,
were his desperate enemies; for they were
fighting for faith and country and freedom,
and to do this makes bold soldiers. So Philip
the prudent had to content himself with
making plans for his great Armada.</p>

<p>Meantime Drake sunned himself in the
Court favour, and books and pictures and
songs were made in his praise.</p>

<p>The <i>Golden Hind</i> was brought ashore at
Deptford, and became a resort for sightseers.
But in spite of much patching she became
so old that she had to be broken up, and the
last of her timbers were made into a chair,
which is still kept in a quiet Oxford library.
So the ship ends her days far away from the
sound of the sea, and of the gay throngs that
used to make merry and dance on her decks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo4"><img class="box" src="images/i_072.jpg" width="400" alt="SIR FRANCIS DRAKE" /></a></div>

<p class="caption no-indent">SIR FRANCIS DRAKE</p>

<p>On the 4th of April the Queen paid a State
visit to the ship, and ordered that it should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>be preserved for ever. A fine banquet was
served on board, and there, before the eyes
of hundreds of onlookers, Elizabeth knighted
the “pirate captain.” She said jestingly that
the King of Spain had demanded Drake’s
head, and now she had a gold sword to cut
it off. Thus Elizabeth openly defied the
Spaniards, who were still raging over their
stolen treasure.</p>

<p>But there were some not in Spain who also
thirsted for revenge upon Drake. Thomas
Doughty’s young brother was his unforgiving
foe. The case was never brought to Court
or indeed to light; but young Doughty wrote
a letter in which he said “that when the
Queen did knight Drake she did then knight
the greatest knave, the vilest villain, the
foulest thief, and the crudest murderer that
ever was born.” The Spaniards bribed him
to try and murder Drake. We hear that
he was put in prison, and we never hear of
his release.</p>

<p>In 1581 Drake was made Mayor of Plymouth.
In 1583 his wife died. He was
then a member of Parliament.  Two years
later he married Mary Sydenham. He never
had any children.</p>

<p>The Queen now appointed Drake among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>others to inquire into the state of the navy;
he was to see to the repairing of ships, to
the building of new ones, and to the means
of furnishing them with stores in case of
sudden war. From this time onwards the
thought of a Spanish invasion was a constant
fear in the minds of the English people. But
Philip was unready, and Elizabeth unwilling
to be the first to begin a war. Elizabeth
changed her mind and her plans in a way
that must have been maddening to the men
who did her work. One good result of her
indecision was that England was better prepared
for the invasion. In those long years
of private warfare money had been gathering,
and the navy made strong and ready for
work. But for men of action, who like to
make a plan and stick to it, and go through
with it at all costs, Elizabeth’s delays and
recalls were bewildering and unreasonable.</p>

<p>In 1585 Philip seized a fleet of English
corn-ships trading in his own ports. Then,
at last, Drake’s long-talked-of expedition
against the Spanish settlements was got
ready and sent out. He had about thirty
ships, commanded by some of the most
famous captains of the time, men like
Fenner, Frobisher, and Wynter, who afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
fought against the Armada. His
general of the soldiers was Christopher
Carleill, “a man of long experience in wars
both by sea and land,” and who was afterwards
said to direct the service “most like
a wise commander.” Drake’s ship was the
<i>Elizabeth Bonaventure</i>.</p>

<p>After a week spent in capturing ships,
the fleet anchored at the Bayona Islands,
off Vigo Bay. The Governor of Bayona
was forced to make terms. He sent “some
refreshing, as bread, wine, oil, apples, grapes,
and marmalade, and such like.” The people,
filled with terror, were seen to remove their
possessions into boats to go up the Vigo
River, inland, for safety. Many of these were
seized; most of them were loaded only
with household stuff, but one contained
the “church stuff of the high church of
Vigo ... a great cross of silver of very fair
embossed work and double-gilt all over,
having cost them a great mass of money.”</p>

<p>The fleet now went on its way by the
Canary Islands. When Santiago was
reached, Carleill landed with a thousand
troops and took possession of the fortress
and the town, for both had been forsaken.
Here they planted the great flag, “which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>had nothing on it but the plain English
cross; and it was placed towards the sea,
that our fleet might see St. George’s Cross
flourish in the enemy’s fortress.” Guns were
found ready loaded in various places about
the town, and orders were given that these
should be shot off “in honour of the Queen’s
Majesty’s Coronation day, being the 17th
of November, after the yearly custom in England.
These were so answered again by the
guns out of all the ships in the fleet, as it was
strange to hear such a thundering noise last
so long together.” No treasure was taken
at Santiago, but there was food and wine.
The town was given to the flames in revenge
for wrongs done to old William
Hawkins of Plymouth some years before.</p>

<p>They had not been many days at sea
before a mortal sickness suddenly broke
out among the men. They anchored off
some islands, where the Indians treated
them very kindly, carried fresh water to
the ships, and gave them food and tobacco.
The tobacco was a welcome gift, to be used
against the infection of the mysterious sickness
which was killing the men by hundreds.
They passed Christmas on an island to refresh
the sick and cleanse and air the ships.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>
<p>Then Drake resolved, with the consent of
his council, to attack the city of St. Domingo,
while his forces were “in their best strength.”
This was the oldest and most important city
in the Indies, and was famous for its beauty
and strength. It had never been attempted
before, although it was so rich, because it
was strongly fortified.</p>

<p>Some boats were sent on in advance of
the fleet. They learned from a pilot, whose
boat they captured, that the Castle of St.
Domingo was well armed, and that it was
almost impossible to land on the dangerous
coast; but he showed them a possible
point ten miles from the harbour. In
some way Drake had sent messages to the
Maroons, who lived on the hills behind the
town. At midnight, on New Year’s Day, the
soldiers were landed, Drake himself steering
a boat through the surf. The Maroons met
them, having killed the Spanish watchman.</p>

<p>“Our General, having seen us all landed
in safety to the west of that brave city of
St. Domingo, returned to his fleet, bequeathing
us to God and the good conduct of
Master Carleill, our Lieutenant-General.”</p>

<p>The troops divided and met in the market-place;
and as those in the castle were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>preparing to meet Drake’s attack from the
sea, they were surprised from behind by
the soldiers marching upon them with flags
flying and music playing. The fleet ceased
firing while the fate of the town was decided
in a battle. By night Drake was in
possession of the castle, the harbour, and
shipping. One of the ships captured they
named the <i>New Year’s Gift</i>.</p>

<p>But after all there was little of the fabled
treasure to be found. The labour in the
gold and silver mines had killed the native
Indians, and the mines were no longer
worked. There was plenty of food and
wine to be had, woollen and linen cloth
and silk. But there was little silver; the
rich people used dishes of china and cups
of glass, and their beautiful furniture was
useless as plunder. The town had to pay a
large sum of money for its ransom, and the
English stayed a month, and fed at its
expense, and took away with them guns
and merchandise and food and numbers of
galley-slaves, whom they set free.</p>

<p>Cartagena, the capital of the Spanish
Main, was the last town to be taken, and
it had been warned. It had natural defences,
which made it very difficult to attack.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>Drake, as we know, had been there before,
and often, since then, he must have dreamed
of taking it. He triumphantly steered his
fleet by a very difficult channel into the
outer harbour. He then threatened the
fort with his guns while the soldiers were
secretly landed by night. They made their
way to the town by the shore, “wading in
the sea-wash,” and so avoiding the poisoned
stakes which had been placed in the ground
in readiness for them. They also routed a
company of horse soldiers sent out from
the fort, as the place where they met was
so “woody and scrubby” as to be unfit for
horses. So they pushed on till they made
a “furious entry” into the town, nor paused
till the market-place was won, and the people
fled into the country, where they had already
sent their wives and children.</p>

<p>A large price or ransom was paid for this
town, equal, it is said, to a quarter of a
million of our money; but it was far less
than Drake had at first demanded. But
“the inconvenience of continual death”
forced them to go, for the sickness was
still taking its prey from among the men,
and it also forced them to give up an
attempt upon Nombre de Dios and Panama.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>The voyage had been disappointing in the
matter of plunder. Most of the treasure
had been taken away from the towns before
the English came, and many of the
officers had died.</p>

<p>They considered the idea of remaining
in Cartagena and sending home for more
troops. They would have had a fine position;
but they decided that their strength
was not enough to hold the town and also
man the fleet against a possible attack by
the Spaniards from the sea. So the lesser
ransom was accepted; the officers offering
to give up their shares to the “poor men,
both soldiers and sailors, who had adventured
their lives against the great enemy.”
They then returned to England, only stopping
to water the ships. They landed
again at St. Augustine, on the coast of
Florida, where they destroyed a fort and
took away the guns and a pay-chest containing
two thousand pounds.</p>

<p>“And so, God be thanked, we in good
safety arrived at Portsmouth the 28th of
July 1586, to the great glory of God, and
to no small honour to our Prince, our
Country, and Ourselves.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> Drake returned to England, it
was to hear the news of the “Babington
plot.” This was a plot to assassinate
Elizabeth, and to place Mary of
Scotland on the throne. In 1587 Mary was
beheaded. In Philip’s eyes the time had
at last become ripe for an invasion of England.
Now that Mary was dead, there
was less danger of France and Scotland
joining forces. And Philip, as a descendant
of John of Gaunt, could put in a claim
that the throne of England, at the death
of Elizabeth, should come to himself or his
daughter.</p>

<p>The Armada was getting ready to sail
in the summer. In April, however, Drake
was sent out again with a small fleet.
His flag-ship was again the <i>Elizabeth Bonaventure</i>.
His second in command was
William Borough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>His orders were “to prevent the joining
together of the King of Spain’s fleet
out of their different ports. To keep
victuals from them. To follow them in
case they should come out towards England
or Ireland. To cut off as many of
them as he could, and prevent their landing.
To set upon the West Indian ships
as they came or went.”</p>

<p>But no sooner was he instructed than the
Queen changed her bold orders to milder
ones. He was not to enter any port by
force, nor to offer violence to any towns,
or ships in harbour. But Drake had got
away to sea without the second orders,
and acted on the first.</p>

<p>He had heard that the ships were gathering
in Cadiz harbour, and there he decided
boldly to seek for them. The outer
and inner harbours of Cadiz were crowded
with shipping, most of which was getting
ready for the invasion of England. Drake’s
fleet sailed in, routed the defending galleys,
and made havoc among the ships,
about thirty-seven of which were captured,
burnt, or sunk. One was a large ship belonging
to the Marquis of Santa Cruz.
They carried away four ships laden with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
wine, oil, biscuits, and dried fruit; “departing
thence,” as Drake says, “at our
pleasure, with as much honour as we could
wish.” They were chased by Spanish galleys,
which did little harm, for the wind
favoured the English as they sailed away
from Cadiz.</p>

<p>The Spaniards thought Drake had gone
to stop the treasure fleet. But Drake
wished to stop the Armada, which was a
much greater affair. He knew now that
Santa Cruz was making his headquarters at
Lisbon. Ships were gathering in the north
of Spain. Recalde, one of the best Spanish
commanders, was waiting with a small fleet
off Cape St. Vincent to protect the treasure
fleet when it arrived. Fifteen big
ships had escaped the attack in Cadiz harbour.
The ships were to meet in Lisbon,
where Santa Cruz was collecting stores and
food.</p>

<p>Recalde succeeded in escaping Drake, and
took his ships safely into Lisbon. Drake
resolved to secure the station he had left.
This was the castle of Sagres, near Cape
St. Vincent. His own officers were staggered
with the boldness of his plan, and
Borough solemnly protested. He had urged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>caution before Cadiz harbour; again he
pleaded for a council of war. He was of
an older school of seamen than Drake, and
was horrified at the ways of the man who
was born, as it has been said, “to break
rules.”</p>

<p>Drake was most indignant at his action,
and put him under arrest, while Borough
expected daily that “the Admiral would
have executed upon me his bloodthirsty
desire, as he did upon Doughty.”</p>

<p class="caption no-indent">Drake at the taking of Sagres Castle</p>

<p>After reading the accounts of Drake in
the stories of the different voyages, we can
understand how his men adored his spirit,
and flocked to his ship to serve under
his flag. To them there was something
magical, and to the Spaniards something
uncanny, in his luck. The English called
him “Fortune’s child,” and the Spanish
called him “the Devil.” But some of the
officers who served with him must have
liked him less. He made his plans swiftly,
and generally well; but the doing of them
had to be swift and sure. Like many
great men he knew he was right, but
could not stop to reason or argue about
his course. He acted upon the instinct of
his genius, with a sure and shining faith
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>in himself, which must have been hateful
to smaller men. In the days of his later
voyages, when he had not the undivided
control of his expedition, he failed, as he
never did when he was alone, “with the
ships not pestered with soldiers,” as he once
said.</p>

<p>The taking of the castle of Sagres
seemed almost an impossibility, so well
did the rocks and steep cliffs defend the
fort. Drake himself commanded the attack
on land, and in the end helped to carry
and pile the faggots against the castle
gate. The commander was slain, and then
the fort surrendered. Thus Drake took
possession of one of the best places on
the coast of Spain for ships to anchor
and get water.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rest of the fleet had taken
and burnt fifty ships laden with wood and
hoops of seasoned wood, for which Santa
Cruz was waiting to make his water-casks.
The loss of these did much damage to the
Armada, and helped to ruin it.</p>

<p>On the 10th of May, having disarmed the
fort of Sagres by throwing the big guns
over the cliffs into the sea, Drake brought
his fleet to anchor in Cascaes Bay, south
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>of Lisbon. He seems to have judged
Lisbon too strong to attack from the sea.
He was prepared to “distress the ships”
had they come out; and he offered battle
to Santa Cruz, who, however, was short of
powder and shot, and had no ships ready
as yet for action.</p>

<p>So Drake went back to Sagres to clean
his ships and refresh his men. He then
sailed for the Azores. A storm parted the
ships, and on the few that were left the
men were anxious to go home. The ship
on which Borough was still a prisoner deserted.
Drake believed that Borough was
responsible for this; and, though he was
beyond reach, in his anger Drake sentenced
him, with his chief officers, to death as
mutineers.</p>

<p>Drake went on with his nine remaining
ships, and came upon a splendid prize, the
big <i>San Felipe</i>, the greatest ship in all
Portugal, richly laden with spice, china,
silk, and chests of gold and jewels. This
prize was valued at nearly a million pounds;
and, besides, she carried secret papers of
great value concerning the East India trade.</p>

<p>On the 26th of June, Drake returned
home after his brilliant campaign. Santa
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>Cruz had indeed gone out to chase him,
but it was too late.</p>

<p>Borough was not found guilty by the
court of law where Drake accused him;
but his grief of mind endured long. Some
time after, he wrote that “he was very fain
to ease it as he might, hoping in good time
he should.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE GREAT ARMADA</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">rake’s</span> raid upon the Spanish coast
made it impossible for the Armada to
sail in 1587. But after waiting so long
Philip made his preparations with an almost
feverish haste. The death of his great
general, Santa Cruz, hindered his plans very
much. Santa Cruz was a commander of
experience and renown, and the man most
fitted, both by his rank and his qualities, to
undertake “the enterprise of England.”</p>

<p>The man chosen to succeed him was the
Duke of Medina Sidonia, whose exalted
rank seems to have been his chief claim to
the difficult place into which he was thrust
by Philip. He had no desire to take the
place; he wrote to Philip and told him quite
simply that he was no seaman, and knew
little about naval fighting and less about
England. But he was ordered to take the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>fleet into the English Channel and take possession
of Margate. He was then to send
ships to bring the Duke of Parma and his
army in safety to England, when Parma was
to assume the command of the expedition.</p>

<p>But, after all, the Armada was not ready
to sail till July 1588, and the months between
then and January were filled by the English
with preparations for defence. They had to
face the difficulties, much greater then than
now, of keeping both men and ships on the
seas, and yet fit for action. Life on board
ship tried the men very severely. We have
seen how often sickness broke out among
the sailors if they were kept long to their
crowded, unhealthy quarters. The feeding
of both navies seems to have been a task of
great difficulty. This was due to the hurried
demand for vast quantities of stores, such
as biscuit and salt meat The Spaniards, too,
owing to Drake’s foresight, had lost their
water-casks, and had to depend on new ones
of unseasoned wood, which leaked.</p>

<p>Lord Howard, a cousin of the Queen, was
made Lord High Admiral of England, and
Drake was his Vice-Admiral and John
Hawkins his Rear-Admiral. With them
served many other famous men, such as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>Fenner, Frobisher, Wynter, and Seymour,
and many younger men from noble families.
All were working hard, with spirits stretched
to an unusual pitch of endurance. In the
letters they wrote about the business in hand
to the Queen and her Ministers of State
there is a note of high courage and defiance;
and a distant echo comes down to us from
the dim old letters of all the stir and bustle
as the men gathered to the ships, and of the
hum of excitement about the clamouring
dockyards. The shipwrights were working
day and night Lord Howard says he has
been on board every ship “where any man
may creep,” and thanks God for their good
state, and that “never a one of them knows
what a leak means.” Sir William Wynter
tells how badly the ships had suffered in the
winter storms, but adds: “Our ships doth
show themselves like gallants here. I assure
you it will do a man’s heart good to behold
them; and would to God the Prince of Parma
were upon the seas with all his forces, and
we in the view of them; then I doubt not but
that you should hear we would make his
enterprises very unpleasant to him.”</p>

<p>The ships are always spoken of like live
creatures, and their personal histories are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>well known and remembered. Lord Howard
says of his Ark (which was bought of Sir
Walter Raleigh by the Queen): “And I pray
you tell her Majesty from me that her money
was well given for the Ark <i>Ralegh</i>, for I
think her the odd (only) ship in the world
for all conditions; and truly I think there
can no great ship make me change and go
out of her.” And again: “I mean not to
change out of her I am in for any ship that
ever was made.”</p>

<p>Drake had “her Majesty’s very good ship
the <i>Revenge</i>” which was so famous then and
afterwards. Lord Henry Seymour writes
from on board “the <i>Elizabeth Bonaventure</i>,
the fortunate ship where Sir Francis Drake
received all his good haps.” Howard and
Drake, with other commanders of experience,
were of one mind; they wanted to go out and
meet the enemy upon the coasts of Spain,
and so prevent the Spanish fleet from ever
reaching England.</p>

<p>Howard pressed this opinion as that of
men whom the world judged to be the
wisest in the kingdom. But the Queen was
unwilling to send the fleet away, and she
still talked of making peace.</p>

<p>Both the Spaniards and the English were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>persuaded that God was fighting with them.
Philip told the Duke of Medina Sidonia, that
as the cause was the cause of God, he could
not fail. In England Drake was saying that
“the Lord is on our side”; and Fenner wrote
to the Queen: “God mightily defend my
gracious Mistress from the raging enemy;
not doubting that all the world shall know
and see that her Majesty’s little army, guided
by the finger of God, shall beat down the
pride of His enemies and hers, to His great
glory.” Nowadays we do not look upon
our enemies as necessarily the enemies of
God.</p>

<p>Howard’s letters show a very noble mind.
He grudged no time or labour in the ordering
of his fleet, down to the smallest matters.
He is full of care for the mariners, and is
anxious that they should be well paid and
fed. He takes the advice of Drake and the
other seamen of greater experience than
himself.</p>

<p>The fleet did at last go out, but was
driven back by the winds; and suddenly,
after the fret and worry and strain of all
those months, there is a pause, and Howard
writes: “Sir, I will not trouble you with any
long letter; we are at this present otherwise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>occupied than with writing. Upon Friday,
at Plymouth, I received intelligence that
there was a great number of ships descried
off the Lizard: whereupon, although the
wind was very scant, we first warped out
of harbour that night, and upon Saturday
turned out very hardly, the wind being at
south-west; and about three of the clock in
the afternoon, descried the Spanish fleet, and
did what we could to work for the wind,
which by this morning we had recovered....
At nine of the clock we gave them fight,
which continued until one.... Sir, the captains
in her Majesty’s ships have behaved
themselves most bravely and like men hitherto,
and I doubt not will continue, to their
great commendation.... Sir, the southerly
wind that brought us back from the coast
of Spain brought them out.”</p>

<p>William Hawkins, then Mayor of Plymouth,
writes that the “Spanish fleet was
in view of this town yesternight, and the
Lord Admiral passed to the sea and out of
sight.” They could see the fleets fighting,
the English being to windward of the enemy.
He was sending out men as fast as he could
find ships to carry them.</p>

<p>There is a legend that Drake and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>officers were playing bowls on Plymouth Hoe
when the news that the Armada was in the
Channel was brought to him by the captain of
a pinnace. Drake calmly finished his game,
the story says, saying there was time to do
that and to beat the Spaniards too.</p>

<p>As the Spanish ships lay in the English
Channel, blinded with the mist and rain, the
Duke sent a boat to get news. Four fishermen
of Falmouth were brought away who
had that evening seen the English fleet go
out of Plymouth, “under the charge of the
English Admiral and of Drake.”</p>

<p>The Spaniards had come out ready to fight
in the old way, in which they had won so
many brilliant victories. They had always
fought their naval battles with great armies
on great ships, much as they would fight on
land. The soldiers despised big guns, and
liked better the bravery of a close fight,
“with hand-thrusts and push of pike.” The
sailors were not prepared to fight at all, but
with the help of slaves they sailed the big
galleys and fighting ships, and the swarm
of smaller troop-ships and store-ships that
swelled the numbers of the fleet which
carried an army.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 541px;">

<p class="caption no-indent">Drake at bowls on Plymouth Hoe</p>
<p>The numbers of the ships on both sides
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>are now said to have been not so very unequal.
If the Spaniards could have fought
in their own way, they must have been easily
victorious. But the English had got the
wind at their back and the enemy in front
of them, and being better masters of their
ships, they had the choice, and they chose
to fight at a distance, and never to board
the big ships till they were already helpless.</p>

<p>Their ships were newer, and built on different
lines, and could sail faster. They were
smaller than our modern men-of-war, but
carried more guns for their size. They were,
as the Spaniards said, “very nimble and of
good steerage, so that the English did with
them as they desired. And our ships being
very heavy compared with the lightness of
those of the enemy, it was impossible to
come to hand-stroke with them.”</p>

<p>The English ships were manned with
sailors and gunners who could both sail the
ships and fight the enemy. The guns were
fired at the hulls of the Spanish ships and
not wasted on the enemy’s rigging, which
was harder to aim at.</p>

<p>The fleets met on the 21st of July, and
there followed a week of fighting and of
disasters to the Spaniards. Yet as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>news of their coming up the Channel came
to those on shore, who watched beside the
beacon fires with anxious hearts, the danger
must have seemed little less fearful than
before. Those who viewed the “greatness
and hugeness of the Spanish army” from
the sea, considered that the only way to
move them was by fire-ships.</p>

<p>Sidonia had steered his great fleet magnificently
through the dangers of the Channel;
he anchored outside Calais to await the
answer to the urgent messages he had sent
to the Duke of Parma. But, as we know,
the “Narrow Seas” were well watched by
the English, and they were so helped by
the Dutch that Parma never reached the
shores of England.</p>

<p>Eight fire-ships were hastily prepared and
sent down upon the Spanish fleet, “all burning
fiercely. These worked great mischief
among the Spanish ships (though none of
them took fire), for in the panic their cables
and anchors were slipped.”</p>

<p>The great fight took place off Gravelines,
on the Flemish coast, where most of the
scattered ships of the Armada had drifted
in the general confusion. The English
hastened to take advantage of this confusion,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>while Sidonia was forming his fleet again
into battle order. They “set upon the fleet
of Spain (led by Sir Francis Drake in the
<i>Revenge</i>) and gave them a sharp fight,” while
Lord Howard stopped to capture a helpless
ship, the finest, they said, upon the
sea. “And that day, Sir Francis’ ship was
riddled with every kind of shot.”</p>

<p>The fight went on from nine in the morning
till six at night, when the Spanish fleet bore
away, beaten, towards the north. Howard
says that “after the fight, notwithstanding
that our powder and shot was well near all
spent, we set on a brag-countenance and
gave them chase as though we had wanted
nothing (or lacked nothing) until we had
cleared our own coast and some part of
Scotland of them.”</p>

<p>Drake was appointed to follow the fleet,
and he writes, “We have the army of Spain
before us, and mind, with the grace of God,
to wrestle a pull with him. There was
never anything pleased me better than the
seeing the enemy flying with a southerly
wind to the northwards. God grant you
have a good eye to the Duke of Parma:
for with the grace of God, if we live, I doubt
it not but ere it be long so to handle the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>matter with the Duke of Sidonia as he
shall wish himself at St. Mary Port among
his orange trees.”</p>

<p>At the end of this letter he says, “I crave
pardon of your honour for my haste, for that
I had to watch this last night upon the
enemy.” And in another letter to Walsingham
he signs himself, “Your honour’s most
ready to be commanded but now half-sleeping
Francis Drake.”</p>

<p>Many of the Spanish ships, being so
crippled, were wrecked in stormy weather
off the coasts of Scotland and Ireland, which
were unknown to them, and thus the more
dangerous. Not half of those who put out
to sea ever reached Spain again. Many
men were killed in battle or died of their
wounds, and they were the most fortunate,
for others were drowned, or perished miserably
by the hands of the natives of the coasts.
Some who escaped were put to death by the
Queen’s orders, and some lingered in the
foul prisons of that time. The instinct of
savage cruelty revives, even in highly civilised
races, in time of war, and spreads, like an
infection.</p>

<p class="caption no-indent">Fighting the Great Armada</p>

<p>We get a glimpse, in an old list of plunder
taken from the Spanish prisoners, of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>brave looks of the vanished host, that included
the flower of Spanish youth and chivalry.
There were “breeches and jerkins of silk,
and hose of velvet, all laid over with gold
lace, a pair of breeches of yellow satin,
drawn out with cloth of silver, a leather
jerkin, perfumed with amber and laid over
with a gold and silver lace, a jerkin embroidered
with flowers, and a blue stitched
taffety hat, with a silver band and a plume
of feathers.”</p>

<p>For some time England was haunted
by fears that the Armada would return to
her coasts, or that Parma would avenge
himself. But the reports of the many
wrecks and of the massacre of Spanish
soldiers eased this present anxiety. And
it was well, for fever and sickness broke
out in the English ships, and the men were
dying in hundreds, “sickening one day and
dying the next,” as the letters say. The
ships had to be disinfected and many of
the men dispersed.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> great Armada was scattered, and
yet the English did not feel secure
from their enemy. The sight of that fleet
so near their shores in “its terror and
majesty,” and the memory of its vast army
of well-drilled soldiers, left a feeling of deep
uneasiness in the minds of wise men. “Sir,”
writes Howard to Walsingham, “safe bind,
safe find. A kingdom is a great wager. Sir,
you know security is dangerous: and had
God not been our best friend, we should have
found it so. Some made little account of
the Spanish force by sea: but I do warrant
you, all the world never saw such a force
as theirs was....”</p>

<p>Fortune had favoured England this time,
but what if Philip built newer and lighter
ships, and really succeeded in landing his
army? They did not as yet know that Philip
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>had no money to build his ships with, and
rumours of a second invasion were plentiful.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, it is true, had suffered
great loss and a crushing defeat to their
pride, but they had not, after all, lost anything
that they already had, but only failed
to get something they wanted very badly
to have, and the second kind of loss matters
far less than the first.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, if the English had
been defeated, it is difficult to think how
darkly their history might have been changed.
It was this thought that made the wise men
sober in the midst of the national joy and
exultation. They saw how much England,
as an island, must depend for strength and
defence upon her navy, and they saw this
much more clearly than before. But Drake
had seen it for a long time. And he had
seen something more. He had seen that
the English navy must be ready and able
to protect her merchant ships by distressing
and attacking her enemies abroad, and that
this was a means of keeping the enemy so
busy abroad that he could not invade the
peace of England at home.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was eager to complete the destruction
of Philip’s navy, now so much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>crippled. In the spring of 1589 she consented
to a new expedition being fitted out, and
appointed Sir John Norreys and Sir Francis
Drake as commanders-in-chief. The two
men had fought together in Ireland. “Black
John Norreys,” as he was called, came of a
famous fighting family, and had served in
the Lowlands and in France with high
courage and skill. During the Spanish invasion
he had been made chief of the land
forces. It is said that in one battle he went
on fighting after three horses had been
killed under him. With him went his
brother Edward, and a famous Welsh captain,
Sir Roger Williams, was his second in
command.</p>

<p>The objects of the expedition were: first,
to distress the King of Spain’s ships; second,
to get possession of some of the islands of
the Azores in order to waylay the treasure
ships; and, lastly, to try to recover for Don
Antonio his lost kingdom of Portugal.</p>

<p>Money for this expedition was raised from
every possible source. The Queen gave six
royal ships and two pinnaces, money, food,
and arms. The forces were made up of
soldiers, gentlemen who wished to make
their fortunes in war, and English and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>Dutch sailors and recruits, most of whom
were pressed. With this large but mixed
army the generals prepared to face the best-trained
soldiers in Europe.</p>

<p>As usual, there were many delays. The
ships were not ready to go out, and much
of the food was consumed before they started.
More was not to be had, though Drake and
Norreys wrote letter after letter begging for
supplies. The Queen had already begun to
regard the expedition with disfavour. Some
days before the fleet sailed, the young Earl
of Essex, her latest Court favourite, had
slipped away to sea with Sir Roger Williams
on the <i>Swiftsure</i>. He was tired of a
courtier’s life, and wanted to breathe freer
air, and to help to fight the Spaniards. The
Queen was very angry, and sent orders for
his arrest, accusing Drake and Norreys of
aiding his escape. But they declared they
knew nothing of his plans.</p>

<p>About this time some Flemish ships appeared
in Plymouth harbour laden with
barley and wine, and Drake seized their
cargoes in the Queen’s name to victual his
fleet, and sailed early in April. The weather
was so rough that several of the ships containing
troops were unable to get beyond
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>the Channel, but even with lesser numbers
the crews were short of food before they
reached Spain.</p>

<p>Philip was very ill at this time, and in
grave anxiety. He knew that Drake and
the English ships might land on his coasts,
that the French might cross the mountains
with an invading force, and that the Portuguese
might arise in rebellion to win back
the crown for Don Antonio. This last
danger seemed to Philip the most urgent,
and Drake guessed this, and landed his men
on the north-west coast at Corunna.</p>

<p>In doing this he tried to obey the Queen’s
orders to distress the King’s ships, and also,
no doubt, to satisfy the craving of his hungry
crews for food and plunder. The lower town
of Corunna was taken, and much wine and
food consumed and much wasted. The
townsfolk were routed and put to the sword,
and their houses burned. An attempt to
take the upper town failed, but the English
were the victors in a sharp battle which took
place some miles from the town, and they
thus secured their retreat to the ships and
sailed away.</p>

<p>The presence of Drake on the coasts
caused great panic, for his name and luck
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>had become a terror to the people. Philip
felt deeply insulted that such an attack
should be made “by a woman, mistress of
half an island, with the help of a pirate and
a common soldier.” In Spain, as we have
seen, the command was always given to
gentlemen of high birth and breeding and
title.</p>

<p>Four days after leaving Corunna, the fleet
first sighted some of the missing ships, and
also the <i>Swiftsure</i> with the missing Earl,
who had “put himself into the journey against
the opinion of the world, and, as it seemed,
to the hazard of his great fortune.” The
<i>Swiftsure</i> had taken six prizes off Cape St.
Vincent.</p>

<p>The two generals had from the first
wished to go straight to Lisbon, and it is
thought that if they had done so, and thus
given the Spaniards no warning of their
coming, they might have had success. But
they were hindered by the Queen’s orders
to destroy the shipping now collected in
the northern ports, and chiefly in Santander.
After leaving Corunna, however, they decided
in council not to attempt that port,
both soldiers and sailors reasoning that the
conditions did not favour an attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>They landed next at the Portuguese
town of Peniche, which lies about fifty
miles north of Lisbon. It was difficult to
land on the surf-bound coast, and some of
the boats were upset and battered. At
last, Essex sprang into the waves and
waded ashore with his soldiers and climbed
the steep cliffs. The commandant, thus
surprised, willingly surrendered to Antonio
as his lawful king, “The king” soon had
a following of peasants and friars, but
neither nobles nor soldiers came to help
him. He was eager to march to Lisbon,
where he thought he was sure of a welcome.
Norreys resolved to march there
overland. Drake, it is said, would have
liked better to attack the town from the
sea in his usual daring but successful
fashion. But the soldiers’ plan carried the
day; and leaving some ships at Peniche,
Drake promised, if he could, to bring the
fleet to meet them at Cascaes, at the mouth
of the river Tagus, south of Lisbon.</p>

<p>There, when he arrived, he waited, not
liking to venture up the river without
knowing where the soldiers were, and not
liking to quit the sea, where he could give
them the means of retreat if necessary.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>For this he was very much blamed by the
soldiers at the time, and afterwards when
he got home. The point is still disputed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the army was encamped outside
the walls of Lisbon, but they never
got inside. The Portuguese refused to join
Don Antonio’s party, and the Spanish governor
kept the gates shut in a grim and
heroic defence. The English sailors were
sick and hungry; they had had no exercise
on board ship to keep them healthy, and
were exhausted with the heat. The stores
and guns were on the ships with Drake.
So, reluctantly, they left the suburbs of
Lisbon and marched to Cascaes, where
they embarked, not without some loss, and
sailed away.</p>

<p>While they were still disputing in the
councils, a fleet of German ships were
sighted, and most of them secured. They
were carrying corn and stores to Spain,
against the rules of war, which bind countries
not concerned in the quarrel to help
neither foe. So the English seized sixty
ships and the stores, both of which had
been destined to furnish the new Armada
of Spain.</p>

<p>Next came into view some English ships
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>with supplies, but also with angry letters
from the Queen; in answer to which Essex
was sent home bearing the news that the
expedition, though diminished by sickness
and death, still meant to sail to the Azores.</p>

<p>On June the 8th a wind had scattered
the fleet, and suddenly left it becalmed.
The Lisbon galleys came out and cut off
four English ships.</p>

<p>The winds continued to prevent the fleet
from going towards the Azores, and all this
time hundreds of sick and wounded men
were dying. After seventeen days at sea,
they landed at the town of Vigo and burned
it, and laid waste the country round. At
length storms and sickness and ill-fortune
drove them home, and the expedition, woefully
shrunken, straggled miserably back.
Don Antonio died, poor and forsaken, some
years later. The English had done a considerable
amount of damage, but at great
cost to themselves; for the loss of life
was terrible, and that of money very considerable.
Both Norreys and Drake were
called upon to account for their failure,
and at the time Drake got the most of
the blame. Perhaps he was more hardly
judged because failure had never come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>near him before, and his successes had
always been so brilliant. His best friends
at Court were dead, and for five years he
was not asked to act in the Queen’s service.
So five years of his life which should have
been the most active were spent in retirement,
if not actually in “disgrace with
fortune and men’s eyes.”</p>

<p>The war was carried on upon the old
lines of distressing the King’s ships, but
with very poor success. After Drake’s
voyage round the world, which encouraged
other adventurers and treasure-seekers, the
Spanish treasure-fleet had been carefully
guarded. This was done by strongly fortifying
the coast stations, by providing an
armed escort, and a service of light ships,
which went frequently to and fro with
letters of advice and warning from the
Indies to Spain.</p>

<p>Drake had ruined this defence in 1585,
and in 1588 again many of the guard-ships
had to be used in the service of the
Armada. A really strong English fleet
might at this time have stayed the treasure,
but Philip continued to gather in his gold,
and also began, with splendid patience, to
rebuild his navy. In 1591 a royal squadron
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>was sent out under Lord Thomas Howard,
and the great battle of Sir Richard Grenville
on the <i>Revenge</i> was fought, “the fight of
the one and the fifty-three,” with the loss of
that ship and the victory of the Spanish fleet.
The Queen made a fighting alliance with
Henry the Fourth of France, who was the
enemy of Philip, and this she felt would
help to keep him out of England. Philip
was now trying to establish a fortified
station on the north coast of Brittany,
from which his new Armada might be
despatched.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE LAST VOYAGE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">rake</span> had settled in Buckland Abbey,
which he had bought from Sir Richard
Grenville. He helped to prepare and furnish
ships for some of the different excursions
against Spain, and he spent much
time on schemes to improve Plymouth. He
paid to have pure water brought to the
town from many miles away; he had flour-mills
built, that the sailors might have
good biscuits provided for them, and he
overlooked the work of fortifying Plymouth,
and making it in all ways a strong naval
station.</p>

<p>As the danger of a fresh invasion by
Philip grew more threatening, Drake was
called to Court again, and it was about
this time that he gave to the Queen his
written story of the voyage to Nombre de
Dios.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>
<p>In 1595 a fresh expedition was arranged
for the Indies, and after the usual bewildering
indecision at Court, and difference
of views and plans (delays that proved
fatal to an excursion whose proper nature
was to be swift and secret, and above all
things powerful), on August 28, 1598, Sir
Francis Drake started on his last voyage.</p>

<p>The story of the expedition begins by
saying that “the Spaniard leaves no means
untried to turn the peace of England into
a cursed thraldom, and this is shown by
his attempts, and also by his greedy desires
to be our neighbour in Brittany, to gain
so near us a quiet and safe road for his
fleet. So the forces were sent to invade
him in that kingdom from whence he has
feathers to fly to the top of his high
desires.</p>

<p>“The invasion was glorious spoken of
long before it was sent, and Sir Francis
Drake was named General. For his very
name was a great terror to all in those
parts, and he had done many things in
those countries to his honourable fame and
profit. But entering into them as the Child
of Fortune, it may be that his self-willed
and peremptory (despotic) command was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>doubted, and that caused her Majesty, as
it should seem, to join Sir John Hawkins
as second in command. He was an old,
wary man, and so leaden-footed” (or slow
in action) “that Drake’s meat would be eaten
before his was cooked. They were men of
such different natures that what one desired
the other commonly opposed. The journey
had so glorious a name that crowds of
volunteers came to them, and they had to
discharge such few as they had pressed.
Yet many times it was very doubtful if the
voyage would be made, till at last the news
came of a ship of the King of Spain, which
was driven into Puerto Rico with two
millions and a half of treasure. So her
Majesty commanded them to haste their
departure, which they did with twenty-seven
ships.”</p>

<p>The generals began to disagree soon
after. Drake wanted to begin with an
attack upon the Canaries, and Hawkins
thought it unnecessary and unwise; and,
as the story says, “the fire which lay
hidden in their stomachs began to break
forth.”</p>

<p>It was five years since Drake had fought
with his old enemies. He did not know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>how much stronger the Spanish defence at
sea had become, owing to the lessons he
had given them, nor how complete Philip
had made the protection of the traffic and
the treasure-ships. He was to see this first
at the Canary Islands, where he tried, and
failed, to make one of his old surprise visits.</p>

<p>The fleet sailed on, and anchored on the
29th of October, for water, at Guadeloupe.
The <i>Delight</i> was the last of the ships to
arrive the next day, and she brought news
that the <i>Francis</i>, a small ship of the company,
was taken by five Spanish ships,
which had been sent out by Philip to bring
home the wrecked ship at Puerto Rico.
This was a great misfortune, because Sir
John Hawkins had made known to all the
company, “even to the basest mariners,”
the places whither they were bound, naming
Puerto Rico, Nombre de Dios, and Panama.
Now the Spaniards would learn this from
their prisoners, and at once send warning
to the coasts.</p>

<p>Drake wanted to give chase at once, but
Hawkins was old and cautious, and desired
to stay and mount his guns, take in water,
set up his pinnaces, and make all things
ready to meet the Spaniards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>And Sir John prevailed, “for that he was
sickly, Sir Francis being loath to breed his
further disquiet.” It took four days to
make those preparations, and always the
sickness of Sir John increased. On the
12th of October Drake brought the fleet up
by a secret way to Puerto Rico, and about
three o’clock that afternoon Sir John Hawkins
died.</p>

<p>In the evening, as Drake sat at supper,
his chair was shot from under him, and
two of his officers received their death
wounds from the Spanish guns. The ships
had to move away. The next night the
English made a desperate effort to fire the
five ships that had come for the treasure.
Four of them were set alight, but only
one was burnt, and by the great light she
gave the Spaniards “played upon the English
with their ordnance and small shot as
if it had been fair day,” and sunk some of
the boats.</p>

<p>Next day Drake, undaunted by failure,
determined to try and take his whole fleet
boldly into the harbour and storm the
place. But the Spaniards, guessing his
desperate intention, and fearing his great
courage, sunk four ships laden with merchandise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
and armed, as they were, and so,
at a great sacrifice, blocked the way for
the English.</p>

<p>Drake took counsel with the soldiers as
to the strength of the place, but most of
them thought it too great a risk, though
one or two were for trying it. “The
General presently said: ‘I will bring you
to twenty places far more wealthy and
easier to be gotten;’ and hence we went
on the 15th. And here,” says the teller
of the story, “I left all hope of good
success.”</p>

<p>On the way to Nombre de Dios they
stopped at Rio de la Hacha, where Drake
had first been wronged by the Spaniards.
This town they took with little difficulty,
and some treasure was won.</p>

<p>On December 27th they were at Nombre
de Dios, which they took with small resistance.
But the people had been warned,
and had fled and hidden their treasure, and
the town was left very bare. So they resolved
to “hasten with speed to Panama.”
The soldiers were under the command of
Sir Thomas Baskerville, who had been a
brave fighter against the Spaniards before
now in Holland and France. They started
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>to go to Panama by the old road well
known to Drake. He, meanwhile, stayed
with the ships and burned the town. He
was about to sail nearer the river when
news came that the soldiers were returning.
The road was only too strongly defended
now, and Baskerville’s men were driven
back with severe loss. They were a small
force, and weak with the long march
through heavy rains; their powder was wet
and their food scarce and sodden, and
Baskerville decided upon a retreat. “This
march,” says the story, “had made many
swear that they would never buy gold at
such a price again.”</p>

<p>Drake, being disappointed of his highest
hopes, now called a council to decide what
was to be done. All the towns had been
forewarned, and told “to be careful and
look well to themselves, for that Drake
and Hawkins were making ready in England
to come upon them.” And now the
company seem to have regarded their leader
with some bitterness, as his brave promises
failed, and the places that he used to know
were found to be changed and formidable.
Now they had to rely “upon cards and
maps, he being at these parts at the farthest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>limit of his knowledge.” But still he proposed
fresh places that had the golden
sound of riches in their names, and gallant
Baskerville said he would attempt both,
one after another.</p>

<p>But the winds drove them instead to a
“waste island, which is counted the sickliest
place in the Indies, and there died
many of the men, and victuals began to
grow scarce. Here,” says Maynarde, who
writes the story, “I was often private with
our General, and I demanded of him why
he so often begged me, being in England,
to stay with him in these parts as long as
himself.... He answered me with grief,
protesting that he was as ignorant of the
Indies as myself, and that he never thought
any place could be so changed, as it were,
from a delicious and pleasant arbour into
a waste and desert wilderness: besides the
variableness and changes of the wind and
weather, so stormy and blustrous as he
never saw it before. But he most wondered
that since his coming out of England
he never saw sail worth giving chase
unto. Yet, in the greatness of his mind,
he would, in the end, conclude with these
words: ‘It matters not, man; God hath
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>many things in store for us. And I know
many means to do her Majesty good service
and to make us rich, for we must
have gold before we reach England.’</p>

<p>“And since our return from Panama he
never carried mirth nor joy in his face, yet
no man he loved must show he took
thought thereof. And he began to grow
sickly. And now so many of the company
were dying of the sickness, and food was
getting so scarce, that at last he resolved
‘to depart and take the wind as God
sent it.’”</p>

<p>But the lurking fever in the swamp had
done its work, and on January 28, 1596,
after a brief fight with illness and death,
Drake “yielded up his spirit like a Christian
to his Creator quietly in his cabin.”</p>

<p>“The General being dead,” we are told,
“most men’s hearts were bent to hasten
for England as soon as they might. ‘Fortune’s
Child,’ they said, ‘was dead; things
would not fall into their mouths, nor riches
be their portions, how dearly soever they
adventured for them.’”</p>

<p>But Sir Thomas Baskerville assumed the
command and took the remains of the fleet
in his charge, and did not return home till
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>he had met the Spaniards and fought a
battle with them at sea.</p>

<p>Before the fleet left Puerto Rico he
burned that port, and sunk two of the ships
no longer needed, and all the prizes. And
there, a league from the shore, under seas,
he left the body of Sir Francis Drake,
heavily freighted with death and silence.
But I like to think that his soul went
a-roving again among the stars.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
